"/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 09, 2025","Just wanted to share that I finally tried cycling to the station instead of waiting for the infuriating, unreliable bus.

Somehow, it took me almost twice as long as predicted... 

Maybe it's because I haven't really gotten used to the route yet and I was riding with my basket full of my stuff so can't go as fast. The distance is shorter than to the gym but took 5 minutes longer.

Anyway, arrived quite sweaty but I just tell myself, if waiting for the bus (that's always late) makes me sweaty too, at least I get to enjoy AC earlier.

Best part? It seems I do actually save quite a bit of money. One way costs me $1.20 for a mere 3 minute bus ride! One month is about $20 saved.

Just two problems:

1. I currently just roll up my pants on the right so the gear/chain won't dirty it. I guess no need to buy garters etc.

2. About the [double rack](https://youtu.be/Dok2vaVSilM) thing to lock the bicycle. I tried to follow the steps on the board: pull towards you + push down but the track wouldn't go down? I tried another one beside and same thing. I gave up and just locked at one of the bottom ones.

I will ride back home later after work so fingers crossed nobody is cheap enough to steal my ancient bicycle.","/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 09, 2025 Just wanted to share that I finally tried cycling to the station instead of waiting for the infuriating, unreliable bus.

The mood of this article is: Neutral (sentiment value of 0.07)

United States (U.S.) egg sandwich brand Eggslut has closed its remaining Singapore outlet at Scotts Square after less than four years in operation.

The closure, while not officially announced by the company, was noticed by netizens and shared on online forum Hardwarezone on Mar. 9.

Eggslut had also withdrawn from South Korea in 2024 and Hong Kong in 2025 due to rising costs and changing spending habits in the two countries, according to South Korea news outlet Chosunbiz and South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Singapore outlets removed from website

Eggslut, which launched in Singapore in September 2021, offered egg sandwiches starting from S$11 each.

A photo provided by a reader of what used to be the Scotts Square outlet showed a vacant store, with no closure notice in sight.

The closure of its Suntec City outlet, which opened in December 2022, was also first noticed by netizens in June 2024.

A check on the Eggslut website showed that the Singapore outlets have been removed from its international locations.

At the time of writing, only stores in Tokyo, Japan and London, United Kingdom are listed as the company's overseas outlets.

A quick check on archival site, Wayback Machine, showed both Suntec and Scott's Road outlets being listed as recently as 2023.

Eggslut's Singapore website also appears to be down.

Exited South Korea and Hong Kong

The egg sandwich brand had started to withdraw from its overseas market, starting with South Korea in 2024.

Industry reports in 2023 indicated that the food service industry in South Korea were met with increasing material and labour costs after the Covid-19 pandemic, reported Chosunbiz.

American brands with a ""brunch"" concept also have a ""higher dependency"" on imported ingredients, and were affected with such costs and fluctuations in exchange rates.

The brand also closed its outlets in Hong Kong in February 2025 after less than two years in operation amid changing spending habits by locals and Chinese tourists, reported SCMP.

SINGAPORE: New citizens enrich Singapore and invigorate its economy “in ways beyond what numbers can show”, said Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Mar 9).

Speaking at the Teck Ghee citizenship ceremony at Nanyang Polytechnic, Mr Lee said new arrivals bring fresh experiences, diverse perspectives and global connections.

This helps Singapore to plug into the world and thrive as a regional hub and a global node.

“This is how cities like London, New York or Shanghai become great centres of culture and prosperity. They attract enterprising and adventurous people from all over the world to go there, to live and work.

“And the steady infusion of new arrivals sharpens them, sparks cross-fertilisation of ideas and cultures, and creates an environment of constant innovation and enterprise,” he said.

Recalling his visit to Google’s headquarters in Silicon Valley two years ago, Mr Lee noted that most of the presenters he met had grandparents who hailed from all around the world.

“That is America’s enormous advantage – it draws top talent from every continent, and therefore it can innovate and stay ahead,” he said, adding that Singapore must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world.

“This is how we became a shining red dot. Because our ancestors came here from many lands, made this their home, and built up this country. And is what we must continue to do, to shine even brighter in future – not just for our own sakes, but for our children and grandchildren too.”

MEASURED AND BALANCED

The Singapore government is “keenly aware” of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, especially as the inflows are not small either, said Mr Lee.

Every year, there are about 30,000 citizen babies born and Singapore takes in about 22,000 new citizens.

“Even dragon year − last year − still not quite 30,000 citizen babies born. So we do need to bring in more people, more talent, more contributions,” he said.

It is therefore crucial for Singapore to manage its immigration inflows carefully by keeping it measured and balanced, said Mr Lee. It is also important to pay close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups and people who are here, and take in people who can fit in and add to society.

He highlighted various ways Singapore integrates its new residents.

All of them undergo the Singapore Citizenship Journey prior to obtaining their citizenship. The Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the People’s Association also run programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities.

“I hope now that you have become citizens, you will participate wholeheartedly in society, and make the effort to integrate,” he told the audience.

“Learn our values and cultural norms, get involved and contribute actively to your communities.”

""OUR SINGAPORE TEAM""

Mr Lee said other Singaporeans must play their part too, such as by making friends with the new arrivals who may be neighbours, colleagues or schoolmates.

He also encouraged Singaporeans to be “big-hearted” and welcome new citizens as valuable members of “our Singapore team”.

“To help new citizens to fit in − to feel at home here, to pick up how our society works, and how we can live harmoniously together. And to firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to our society.”

Rounding up his address, Mr Lee emphasised how Singapore’s success has always been built on its people – those who came earlier from distant lands, their children born here, and those who continue to join the country every year from all over the world.

“As long as we open our hearts and minds, we can together build a nation that remains vibrant, cohesive, and full of opportunity for those who call it home.”

"New citizens enrich Singapore, invigorate economy ‘in ways beyond what numbers can show’: SM Lee","It's really curious why Singapore continues to need so many new foreigners to drive our economy. 


First off, Singapore benefitted from the rise of China, as an alternative gateway into the China market to Hong Kong. However, we all know that China's relations around the world are getting strained, and in fact many MNCs have pulled out of the China market into neighbouring Asian countries instead.


Second, we know from Covid, that foreigners indeed take up most of the top positions. When Singapore reopened after Covid, there was an employees' market available which was caused by the void left behind by foreigners who had fled Singapore to return to their home countries.


Third, what other benefits do foreign firms really get by setting up part of their business in Singapore? Singapore has no natural resources, labor is much more expensive than other parts of the world, and these firms need foreigner talent instead of Singaporeans to fill their positions. So why even bother setting up in Singapore in the first place? How did Singapore even get a high GDP growth last year? Seems to me that higher government spending is artifically propping up the economy, similar to what Biden was doing in the US in his last months in office. Is that why the government wants to collect even higher tax revenues? To keep spending to maintain this economic growth?

"New citizens enrich Singapore, invigorate economy ‘in ways beyond what numbers can show’: SM Lee","I think the open-leg metaphor describes us very well. The gov is like the husband, the country the wife. 

A good relationship is when both partners respect and support each other, whether you can afford to eat durians or peanuts after dinner. They build a healthy, strong relationship through mutual understanding and compromise. Even when they are not in the best shape, they are able to make the best of what they have and still find happiness.

What we have now is, the husband is like a pimp, the wife his whore. He lets unmentionable number of men in her, while he collects massive amount of earnings off her. What the men are allowed to do to her depends on how much they are willing to pay.

He finds excuses to justify his causes for allowing this. They live in a façade of happiness covered by dirty wealth. He convinces himself he's noble, because strange men leave happy, and he donates to charitable causes with that money. Just like how scammers convinced themselves that they create thousands of jobs, in the fight of trying to stop them.

The wife feels abused, betrayed and used, while getting only a fraction of her earnings. She is powerless to do anything because her husband yields too much power. 

There's a ray of light somewhere, when some men and women tried to stand up against him, but he never fails to find ways to put them down, no matter how despicable the methods are.

Perhaps the husband would change for the better, or someone finally overpowers him. The wife can only hope, that one day when she wakes, some kind of miracle has been bestowed upon her.","New citizens enrich Singapore, invigorate economy ‘in ways beyond what numbers can show’: SM Lee I think the open-leg metaphor describes us very well.

The mood of this article is: Neutral (sentiment value of 0.07)

United States (U.S.) egg sandwich brand Eggslut has closed its remaining Singapore outlet at Scotts Square after less than four years in operation.

The closure, while not officially announced by the company, was noticed by netizens and shared on online forum Hardwarezone on Mar. 9.

Eggslut had also withdrawn from South Korea in 2024 and Hong Kong in 2025 due to rising costs and changing spending habits in the two countries, according to South Korea news outlet Chosunbiz and South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Singapore outlets removed from website

Eggslut, which launched in Singapore in September 2021, offered egg sandwiches starting from S$11 each.

A photo provided by a reader of what used to be the Scotts Square outlet showed a vacant store, with no closure notice in sight.

The closure of its Suntec City outlet, which opened in December 2022, was also first noticed by netizens in June 2024.

A check on the Eggslut website showed that the Singapore outlets have been removed from its international locations.

At the time of writing, only stores in Tokyo, Japan and London, United Kingdom are listed as the company's overseas outlets.

A quick check on archival site, Wayback Machine, showed both Suntec and Scott's Road outlets being listed as recently as 2023.

Eggslut's Singapore website also appears to be down.

Exited South Korea and Hong Kong

The egg sandwich brand had started to withdraw from its overseas market, starting with South Korea in 2024.

Industry reports in 2023 indicated that the food service industry in South Korea were met with increasing material and labour costs after the Covid-19 pandemic, reported Chosunbiz.

American brands with a ""brunch"" concept also have a ""higher dependency"" on imported ingredients, and were affected with such costs and fluctuations in exchange rates.

The brand also closed its outlets in Hong Kong in February 2025 after less than two years in operation amid changing spending habits by locals and Chinese tourists, reported SCMP.

Mothership has reached out to Eggslut for comment.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","I think the tough competition in Singapore tends to result many parents and even the children to be narcissistic and more likely to look down on others who are not as talented as themselves. 

Growing up in Malaysia, my schooling days were not as stressful compared to my peers in Singapore. Eventhough I was a laidback person, I still manage to get into the field of medicine in the top university in UK. During my 4th year, I had a chance to select a hospital for my one month elective. I chose to enter cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery department in NUH because it was close to home and NUH is indeed reputable.

I was grouped with 9 other Singaporean students and let me tell you, they were not entirely pleasant. Most interestingly, they loved to show off how fortunate they were in securing electives in countries like US and UK. They scoffed at me for “wasting” my electives by choosing Singapore and not other top hospitals like John Hopkins. Furthermore in every discussion, they always loved to argue with each other and most of the times, no consensus could be reached because everyone was so adamant of their own opinion. I was looked down by others because I did not participate in their confrontation or choose a side.

I did not bother with all their usual banters and arguments but a few incidents showed me how selfish they could be. In one of the early morning, a Chinese old granny was admitted because she had an heart attack a night prior. I was grouped with another 2 girls and our task was fairly simple, we needed to take her history and present the findings in front of our lecturer at noon. The patient was sleeping soundly so I suggested we could come back later when she would be awake for breakfast. The 2 girls wanted to finish it quickly and to my utter shock, one of the girls just went to her bed, shook her shoulders and called out “Auntie! Auntie! We have questions to ask you!” to an elderly who just had a heart attack! The granny was jolted from her sleep and visibly confused by the sudden intrusion. I felt really bad because she looked weak and tired but she was nice enough to attend to the girls. Another problem arose when we found out she could only speak Mandarin and the girls were bananas so I had to be the one taking history. One of the girls immediate comment was “Why can’t they all speak English, so troublesome”. I was really put off by her remarks. The granny was in a daze so sometimes she could not really answer my questions properly. Due to the fact that the girls could not understand our conversation, they got impatient when they did not get their answers. One girl was like “Why you so slow, your uni never taught you to take history ah?” and they snickered among themselves. I was actually more concerned about the granny so I did my things quickly so she could get some rest. I could always come back later when she was feeling much better. I could not understand the mentality of the 2 girls. They were going to be future doctors and to behave such way was just inexcusable. There were many similar incidents even worse but those stories would take up too much time.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","I am very glad your experience sharply highlighted Singaporean's bad culture - elitism and superiority, which prompted you to write this post to further raise more awareness among redditors in SG.

But unfortunately, our bad culture is not limited to just which school ""my child"" is attending, it is everywhere. Some common unfounded basis for discrimination includes jobs, nationality and race.

We typically tried to ignore labour workers, such as bus driver or cleaners. Just recently, I have a Singaporean friend marrying a foreigner and the parents commented that it is a ""downgrade"". This friend, at around 30 years old, said on a separate occasion that she will never allow her children to marry another race. (**Note**: These are my observations, not my actions. I am stating these as examples of discrimination that are still happening in Singapore, please do not downvote because of these examples. I voiced my dissent at the time of these instances.)

So let's challenge ourselves to take actions to be more accepting of others. Smile and slightly nod your head down to bus drivers, cleaners and any person who serves you, or even better say ""thank you"". Remove the mentality in yourselves that human can be segregated by any labels - schools, nationality, race or gender. We are all human, sharing this beautiful Earth with many other amazing living things.

For OP, it will take courage on your part to reject being labelled. Coming CNY your relatives will be asking which school are you going to, and then sound their approval (or disapproval). Take it upon yourself to ask them what is their opinions and have an objective conversation with them. At the start of your JC, there will be orientation and there will be far fewer students from other ""neighbourhood"" schools, take it upon yourselve to really interact with them and discover their individual characters and strength as a normal friend. (**Note**: I am just using your word, but labelling schools as ""good"" or ""neighbourhood"" is already discriminatory)","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.

It's not like I ended up a minister or some crazy high-achiever. I'm in a 9-6 job like most others who did not go to so-called 'top schools'. Everyone's just trying to make it through. In the end, it doesn't matter. 

What matters is really how you sleep at night - how you treat others, how you treat yourself, how you deal with anything life throws at you. There's just no point in making others feel small.

On another note, I've noticed this problem is so much more prevalent in singapore than in other countries just because this is such a tiny place, so everyone knows every other school and it becomes too easy to judge people based on stereotypes of each school's students. This must be the only country in the world where people ask 'which schools did you attend?' to know more about you. (School, not university or course!)

I am quite social and would always try to strike up a conversation with the people I was serving. I genuinely want to be good to others and it made the job so much better. For the most part, people would be receptive and would engage in conversation. Once a shift or so, I'd get someone that would not be as receptive. Best case, they ignore my efforts, worst case they are just rude. I would not give up and continue the conversation if I could and felt it was okay to do so. Without fail, people changed how they spoke to me  after asking me what do I do when not serving. I would reply I am in school. I would leave it at that. If they dug deeper I'd tell them that I am in law school. The way they spoke, their face expression, the tone of their voice and overall their interaction with me would completely change. I could never understand that. I am the same person right now and 5 minutes ago before you found out what I do.

From my personal experience, people are sensitive to salesperson/sales assistant/promoter. And sometimes they look down on salespeople. Or sometimes they are just purely frustrated with their personal situations (which has nothing to do with you) and are just using salesperson to vent their frustration.

Speaking from my personal experience, I develop and sell my software (SaaS) for a living. And I encountered what you mentioned, just that mine is over the phone (cold call). Some of my friends who do insurance sales for a living, shared similar stories. 

Yours is different in the sense that they approached you, while salesperson approach them. Not entirely similar but the experience I feel is similar. Because I had also been a chocolate promoter with FNA (Cocotree).

I think they look down on salesperson / sales assistant because they think in every way they are better than sales people. I don't know why or what made them think so highly of themselves. They, I mean prospects, treat me better when they know more about me, and especially when they hear more about my credentials and some of the companies that I worked with... Then they treat me with a little more respect.

I never let my ego get in my way. I choose to develop and sell my software for a living. Previously, I was doing a technical (non- external client facing) job like database analyst/software engineer. So I saw how my former colleagues treated salesperson (not too bad but can be better). I always try to treat sales person / promoter with more respect since I was once a chocolate promoter and now a software salesperson.

Anyway customers are King! Perhaps, swallowing your ego and continue to serve them well with a smile. This is what a Taiwanese waiter (I was impressed by his service) taught me. The #1 rule in Taiwan and Japan service industry, he said. Unless they get verbally or physically abusive.

And of course I'm slow I'm a part timer without 17 years of supermarket packing experience what do you expect?

If they do that I would purposely slow down and hum a cheerful tone just to spite those shitfaces. Thank god I'm a part timer so even if I get complaints it wouldn't even affect me.

The auntie that mentored me and my friends told us that 'the customer is always right' and to always 'let the customer win'. She told us this knowing that we would encounter trash within our short working period there. And we definitely did.

This culture of looking down on the 'low skilled' in Singapore is a true disappointment that I had to find out for myself. The stigma is real but very low key.

Since the older players tend to do better, they end up getting more playing time, and as they progress through the ranks they are selected for better teams and more elite programmes, receive better coaching, and play more games against better competition.

I had decent marks in school, enlisted in the Army fresh out the gate. Did a solid eight years of service, and have worked general labor at a factory, worked retail for four years, and finally got the chance to work for a security company that acknowledged my skills and history (instead of telling me I'm over-qualified as a lame duck excuse not to hire me).

If I had a dollar for every time some parent or elderly person looked at me at any of my jobs outside of the military and had snubbed me as some inept, lesser class citizen, I'd be able to retire by now.

There's no sense of common decency in some folk. That's just the way things are. I chose to work retail because I liked interacting and socializing with people. When I worked as a Cashier (and later as a Customer Service Manager) I've been harassed, spit on, and told I'm worthless because I don't have a job that ""provides a benefit to society, and that I must've been a crap student that couldn't land a better job"".

I work contract security now, because I like making people feel safe, and I have the skills to do so. However, I wanted to have less stress than being a full fledged police officer. I'm in shape, polite, and yet I have folks who look at my uniform and snub me as 'mall-cop' or 'rent-a-cop'. Sure, like they let mall cops work a research facilities and power plants.

I had a friend recently who came in for a problem who was seen in one of the teaching hospitals like NUH. She was a really interesting case as well to medical students because apparently to the doctors it was a “classic” case (not very sure what that means). And honestly she was also a bit unhappy that everyone was coming to her every few hours and it was frustrating because everytime I visited her there were medical students around. And I guess it was only when one of our friends who is a medical student came by to see her did I understand how important this was for them. Apparently it isn’t easy understanding a disease because they present in different ways. The medical students really need to “gain experience” per se to “get” a disease. Like she said for my friend, it could present with her pee-ing a lot or her getting an infection, and as medical students they needed to see the myriad of cases so that the next time I see a disease like this, no matter how it presents, they will be able to catch it and treat it appropriately. She also said it wasn’t easy for them... They were quite paiseh about seeing patients at first and waking them up but everytime they don’t wake the patient up their senior doctors tell them they have just wasted an opportunity to learn something new. So they have learned to be more thick-skinned in approaching patients. And then there is the other spectrum. The people who are unhappy that doctors cannot diagnose their problem. So they go doctor hopping and spend excessively doctor by doctor. And by the time they reach the last doctor, they got something much worse than what they get at the start. So you see... which would you prefer? Someone disturbing you every 1/2 hour to talk to you to save the many, or you seeing many doctors because these doctors cant diagnose you. Aiya honestly its quite tough la... But I would say its a personal choice rather than a public problem. Cannot force people to be uncomfortable for the greater good and cannot blame people for not doing their job when their job entails being like god and fixing a human right?","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","I can really relate to what OP says about the way people of high SES treats people differently, depending on their SES. IMO they’re just people living in a safe space for too long and really forget about the realities on earth. Got to symphatise for their children for being raised in such constricted environment. 

Hijacking OP’s post here... 

And what happens when you tell a person from low SES you’re going into a top JC? They tell you to be humble and not brag about your place in an elite school.

I was working as a cashier at a supermarket and although the supermarket was located in a relatively more wealthy area, the cashiers were mostly aunties and uncles who have worked there for perhaps more than 5 years and were “seasoned workers”. There were also a few younger workers whom I got the chance to talk to and were more open with sharing their opinions with me.

I didn’t immediately quit after JC started(jc 2 now), and worked on the weekends, but basically everyone knew which school I went. On my last day, this guy, who was also working as a cashier and just recently finished his poly, told me “eh bro, remember stay humble ah”. I nodded and, well, quit.

At that time I merely thought it was a passing remark, or that that guy is just too opinionated to tell me how to live my life, but recalling back the remark now, and also linking it to my experiences with people of higher SES has shown a difference between the mindset of these people. 

A person of high SES would scoff at you for being “low class” but treat you with equal respect as they would want others to treat their offsprings when you’re what they consider “equal” to their children. On the other hand, a person of lower SES would frankly tell you to keep your chin down in order to survive in society, regardless of whether you are high or low SES, as they merely want the best for you, or just a piece of advice from what they might have experienced. 

On one side one is self-absorbed, and always aiming for the best, when they already have the best. While on the other side one is self-directed, and treating everyone the same way.

It's great that you are very aware of and conious about this issue, and the good thing is as you grow older and start to counter more and more people from more diverse background, you would find most people really don't care much about these things, it's just some jobs and schools tends to have these kind of attitude more often than others.

Broadly speaking, going to University is much easier from the JC route as the entry requirements are generally more skewed towards the JC kids but now the Govt has helped to somewhat level the playing field in a way with the introduction of Universities that largely admit polytechnic students such as SIT and the programs in SIT aren't much different from the local universities either. 

There's also a growing trend of people who score well enough to enter a good JC but choose to enter polytechnic instead because of a variety of factors.

If anyone is doubting is poly people can make it, I'm now in one of the 3 local unis studying computer science so yeah, with enough hard work and effort, anything is possible. 

So I guess it really comes down on what a person hopes to achieve and what route he/she wants to take.

Even as a medical student, you have to clarify and fully explain your intention before carry out any history taking or examination. We also require patient's consent before we could proceed. Compared to Singapore however, I find the local medical students here tend to be aggressive when handling the patients. Most patients here do not realised they could decline the lecturer/student's request and are often pressured to be examined. The medical students in NUH are impressive when it comes to medical knowledge but they do not possess the necessary soft skills and empathy when talking to a patient. From my observation, they tend to be clockwork in their questioning and often fail to realised when said patient is uncomfortable. Even some of the qualified medical professional are not exempted from such behaviour. During ward rounds, the doctor in charge would take the patient's chart and discuss extensively about the patient's disease without acknowledging the patient in front of him. I could feel the patient's uneasiness as his medical history is shared among the students and patients nearby without his consent. Sometimes patients are reduced into case history and statistic rather than a human being. Often in discussion, they would address patients by using their diseases rather by their name. In UK, we would get into huge trouble if we do not respect the patient's wishes but not much in Singapore.  

If you are planning to do elective in Singapore, you need to be wary about the competitiveness of local medical students. Due to limited patients in the ward, the students can get territorial when searching for interesting cases. In my group, there were some students voluntarily withheld information by asking the patients not to speak to other students besides themselves. I think it was selfish and insanely childish for people to keep interesting cases to themselves. I did not hang out much with the local students in my group and instead I joined with the international students. Most international students also expressed similar concerns like mine so we ended up became best buds throughout the whole elective although we were from different departments.   

One thing I do like about NUH is their teaching sessions. They hold a lot of seminars in the hospital and everyone including the doctors is encouraged to join the seminars. They have discussion on interesting cases, new procedures and techniques, drugs, etc. You could even join seminars that do not belong to your department. I think I probably joined like 3-5 seminars each week and you learn something new everyday. ","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.

One thing I do like about NUH is their teaching sessions. They hold a lot of seminars in the hospital and everyone including the doctors is encouraged to join the seminars. They have discussion on interesting cases, new procedures and techniques, drugs, etc. You could even join seminars that do not belong to your department. I think I probably joined like 3-5 seminars each week and you learn something new everyday. ",2757

To say that I am 'Objectively wrong' would mean that my 'Objective' of stating on the simple fact that there are talents that require no form of education is complete bullshit, because apparently everyone is a braindead retard until they realise their 'place in life'. Guess what? 

The 'obvious that there are people lack the aptitude to excel academically' and 'the average student in an 'elite' school is almost definitely more intelligent' are some of the most pretentious things I've ever heard in my entire life, and yet I am willing to admit that that the former is half true, but I will stave off my critcisms for the latter after.

For the former, what you are looking for is 'people who are unable to excel in academic thinking and memory retension', seeing that common sense is something that can never be tested nor graded. You are correct that some people are lacking in such mental faculties and I concede that you are correct in that case. But what you are incorrect, which I full-heartedly you do not push off with the pretentiousness of a prideful parent, is that 'excelling academically is the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY OF SUCCESS'. 

'There are many in the elite schools that do not rely on route learning'. If we want to play strawman then I can play strawman too, but this is such a basic defensive line of playing the devil's advocate I am just going to make a simple response; it doesn't matter. The parents are the problem, not the students. I couldn't give two shits if the kids get As or Ds. I care if the parents mistreat other kids IN FRONT OF ME AND THE DAMN KID SIMPLY BECAUSE THE KID IS UNABLE TO AFFORD THE DAMN MONEY TO PAY FOR TUITION. That isn't goddamn human behavior. That's demeaning to both the kid they are heckling AND their own kid, since it shows them that they are only worth as possessions in the adults eyes.

Can you imagine someone, who claims to love you, beating you regularly every day simply because you didn't get a A1 when you got an A2? Beating you because you hate Physics but they force you to take triple science anyway, and mentally conditioning (which is fucking brainwashing mind you) them to think that it's FOR THEIR OWN GOOD? And then realising, after exploring the world and making friends in other countries, or exploring the internet and meeting all kinds of people, that the kind of life you're living is a fucking joke? Can you imagine being in their place? 

Of course not. Every life is different, but EVERY LIFE IS EQUAL.

As for the latter, I couldn't even begin to explain why school=/=intelligence, or how your pitiful defense of ""by conventional definitions"" has about the subtlety of a giant conducting espionage. But I know that you will just brush me off as someone who doesn't understand the 'beauty of the education system' and that I am just a waaaaay too sympathetic strawberry jackass'. So I'm not going to take the bait, and simply ignore that last sentence.

I will not catagorise you into a niche that you will vehemently object to. But do understand that by saying someone is 'objectively wrong' is a direct spit in the face to anyone who has witnessed this kind of suffering.

Let me put it this way, to end it off. 

When I was in Primary School, everyone was the same. When I was in Secondary school, the Primary School friends who got into the 'elite schools' DISAPPEARED for four years. 

When I got into JC and later met them for outings, they had completely changed.

But now, after a year out of JC, and I see that they have completely isolated themselves even from their other schoolmates and secluded themselves to what I can only assume their parents consider a 'better studying atmosphere' or whatever kind of bullshit they say to avoid saying 'conditioning chamber', I can tell you now.

I've come across doctors who excuse or even encourage such behaviour too. What you described in your first post is rather shocking to me though, not that I'm doubting your account, but perhaps because I've not been in the wards for long enough to personally observe anybody being so rude and selfish! (Tbh, I somewhat wish you had told them off for their behaviour and refused to converse with the poor granny on their behalf lol. but I understand that you wouldn't have wanted any conflict either). I think there's a vast spectrum of personalities amongst students and I rly hope I don't come across as defensive, but just hoped to reassure you that the people that you were unfortunate enough to be grouped with during your elective aren't representative of local med students as a whole! personally, amongst the batchmates & seniors i've been grouped with so far, we share the same policy of always waiting for the patient to be awake even if we have to come back multiple times and find the patient asleep every single time. we also forgo our chance to examine patients with rare conditions if we realise that many of our batchmates/seniors have disturbed them already. That being said, I don't know what the majority of students are like, and I certainly wouldn't know about how it's like 'compared to doctors in Malaysia/UK' as I haven't had any electives yet (but for the few UK-trained doctors I've observed so far, i've always liked how they treat their patients). 

It makes me wonder though, whether pressure (from peers/tutors/deadlines/etc) eventually cause some students to abandon the priorities & principles that they originally had, or whether they were already selfish to begin with? If it's the latter, then maybe the admissions process is still very much flawed, but if it's the former, what went wrong along the way? :/ Perhaps a vicious cycle of ""monkey see monkey do"" also contributes to this. E.g. i suspect that some students think it's ok to wake sleeping patients up because they see doctors/nurses do it so often. But they forget that the context is different because they aren't contributing to the care of those patients, so they shouldn't be disturbing them. And it's worse when it comes to behaviour that is borderline unethical, but becomes acceptable just 'cause ""I saw Dr So-and-So do this before, so it must be fine for me to do the same.""     
I sure hope that this won't happen to my friends and I despite the stress, but being human, i'm sure we will face the same temptation at some point. So thanks for your post - it's a good reminder for me to consciously watch what I do and always always put myself in the patients' shoes, before the stress tempts me to do differently :)

Lastly, to everyone who comes across this comment - it's your right to say no to a medical student who wants to discuss your condition/examine you, please don't say yes just out of pressure! We wouldn't want to unknowingly cause you further distress - although we see many patients in the hospitals day in day out and it may thus be tempting to think of being hospitalised as a small issue, when we stop to think about it, it would be a significant event to each patient . Of course, saying no nicely would beat saying no fiercely, we're all humans... :P And of course if you are really alright with it, then we really appreciate it!! every learning opportunity helps us to be a better doctor in future :)

>'Objectively wrong' is more of your own opinion, seeing that I made opinionated points on my own interactions with parents that seemed to only have the best interests of their own pride in having 'elite children' that appear to only be able to read from a book slightly better than others. To say that I am 'Objectively wrong' would mean that my 'Objective' of stating on the simple fact that there are talents that require no form of education is complete bullshit, because apparently everyone is a braindead retard until they realise their 'place in life'. Guess what? 

No you didn't. You made general statements that 

1) it's not cool to brag about education because people can achieve it given enough time 

2) people with good grades are muggers and had grades beaten into them 

And when you got called out you changed your stance to ""I can't be objectively wrong because I'm stating an opinion"" and why did parents come into the picture? 

Anyway let me address your arguments. 

1) I agree that it's not nice to brag but usually it's the parents rather than the kids that are doing it. As for the latter part, this is objectively wrong as the other person has pointed out. Firstly, not anyone can achieve a given academic qualification given enough time. Secondly, even if they could, it also shows that they are less competitive/able than someone who could do it quicker. A company is not going to take a chance on Bob who took 20 years to finish his CS degree. His knowledge is probably obsolete. Either that or they pay him as much as a fresh grad at 50 years old. How's he going to retire? 

Now obviously there are people who due to circumstances beyond their control couldn't get good grades in school. But there are also people with inferior cognitive and analytical capabilities than others. That's why we have EM3 streams. Of course there will always be false positives but that's how life is 

For (2) it's easy just look at universities. Clearly some people are getting perfect CAP and their parents clearly aren't beating them at that age. 

3) talent is irrelevant to getting good grades 

I attended the GEP in secondary school. Many of my batchmates got 7-9 A1s without tuition, beatings or working particularly hard (playing starcraft/MMOs through exam period). 

Similar observations in JC although coursework is more challenging. Many people mug like hell and perform worse than other people who don't study much.

Yeah there are talents in every sector not just academic. Musical talent, photography, art, etc. A lot of it is aptitude but effort can make up for that, just like in academics 

>The 'obvious that there are people lack the aptitude to excel academically' and 'the average student in an 'elite' school is almost definitely more intelligent' 

I'd be willing to stake a bet on the latter based on career earnings, IQ scores etc. Whatever metric you propose. 

>But what you are incorrect, which I full-heartedly you do not push off with the pretentiousness of a prideful parent, is that 'excelling academically is the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY OF SUCCESS'. 

Nobody is saying that. You are pulling this out of nowhere. 

Anyway just to address that, success has so many definitions anyway but let's just assume that having a comfortable income = success for the sake of argument, then excelling academically is by no means the only possible way. However it's probably the shortest and easiest path.

I don't know if being beaten for getting A2 or having to pay for your own tuition is a true story. It's certainly nowhere near normal and I have never seen anything like it in my school experience.  But it doesn't support any of the arguments you have made.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","**Communism**

In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism and anarchism (anarcho-communism), as well as the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution. 

The two classes are the working class—who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society—and the capitalist class—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production.

The revolution will put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

It's very clear that the vast majority of those unvaccinated are medically unfit for vaccination.

BCG is the only vaccine that has full coverage in Singapore, in the 99-100% range. Every other vaccine including MMR, polio, Hib, Hep B, and tetanus have a coverage of 90-95%.

COVID currently have a coverage of 83%, however this includes 10% of ineligible children. This makes the 12+ coverage of COVID vaccination be at 92%, within the 90-95% range.

For partially vaccinated, this is at 85%, which is equal to 94% of adults.

This means that those who choose to not vaccinate is estimated to be around 1% of the population.

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","98.4% of cases have minor or zero symptoms. This means nearly all who catch covid  recover and keep living, indeed they gain natural immunity which is being proven to have much greater prophylactic value than any vaccine in the face of future contagion. 

There is no value given for the vaxxed vs unvaxxed ratios of asymptomatic covid at MOH. If you find it, please share. The good news is that nearly all who get covid recover, it would be helpful to know what ratio of vaxxed to unvaxxed is in that 98% (does it proportionately represent the the ratio of total vaxxed population? ). 

Of the remaining 1.6% infirmity is 50/50 Vaccinated vs unvaxxed, thus the argument that only unvaxxed are a burden on the healthcare system is an exaggeration,though the case that unvaxxed are over represented and overly burdensome in ICU is valid. 

With a hypothetical 100%vax rate, 100% of icu visits and deaths will be vaxxed individuals (vs the 30% vaxxed deaths currently), the vax does not give immunity. Isolation of unvaxxed to their homes should skew the forward numbers more in the direction of vaxxed being the burden on the healthcare system and give a truer overview of the prophylaxis of mrna vaccines. 

Regarding deaths, I cannot find a summary of vaxxed vs unvaxxed deaths since vaccination started nor since herd vaxxed rate was achieved, this would be useful. On the daily reading of MoH stats 4/6 recent deaths were vaxxed 2 unvaxxed, age and comorbidity were factors. 

Seperately and for cinsideration of preventable deaths, Singapore has over 2200 smoking related deaths per year (thus 142 covid deaths and 4400 smoking deaths since covid emerged in Wuhan) yet cigarettes remain on sale and smoking legal.. The impact of reducing deaths through eliminating smoking would of course not be seen for decades but is worth considering as second hand smoke also contributes to lung health issues in society. 
Restrictions on sugar would also reduce death from diabetes. Diabetes kills nearly 4400per annum (thus 8800sonce covid broke out).

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","Likely a very unpopular opinion but because I'm part of a so-called minority, just thought I wanted to share a different perspective amidst all the scolding of ""anti-vax idiots"".

Myself and some of my family members are only partially vaccinated so far (one dose or not yet 2 weeks after second dose) because we chose to be vaccinated with Sinopharm instead of the mrna vaccines, simply because we are just more comfortable with the inactivated vaccines that have been used for other past treatments. Say what you will about experts' comments and evidence about the safety of mrna vaccines, I'm no expert to challenge it, but I don't think it's unreasonable to choose a different vaccine that my family and I feel more comfortable with, as opposed to the mrna ones that the majority are taking. It's not even that I don't want to get vaxxed, I just want a different vax. Any take on such a view? 

We don't think that vaccines are ineffective, nor think that it's some chip that government tries to implant in us to track us or whatever. I have also taken other vaccines, such as the one against cervical cancer, so I don't doubt the effectiveness of vaccines in general. It is simply a matter of preference that we chose Sinopharm as opposed to the ones in the national programme, and I don't think it's a luxury to be able to have a choice. 

The problem is, people who follow the news might know that Sinopharm arrived in Singapore only in late Aug to early Sep, and the days following its arrival, you might also have seen news about the high demand and overwhelming response for it. My family members and I made appointments with multiple providers of it but to no avail because appointments were booked so quickly that I wasn't quick enough to be part of the first batch to receive it. My second dose is in slightly under a week, meaning that it would be about 3 weeks before I'm counted as fully vaxxed. I can accept the dine-in restrictions, and while it means some inconvenience or not having the occasional luxury of dining at certain establishments, it does not exactly affect my way of life. But to restrict entry into malls, means I cannot takeaway food from anywhere but hawker centres/coffee shops or standalone outlets - which are rather inconvenient from my school and home - nor go grocery shopping, many of which are in malls. Nevermind that I can't buy takeout from certain food outlets in malls, guess I'll cook more often, but wait, I can't go grocery shopping. You're gonna tell me that I can go to standalone outlets, but as aforementioned, there are none near my school or home. I would have to go out of my way to carry out these basic activities and increase travel time and exposure. I see comments like: ""I can't go grocery shopping! Well then get vaxxed you idiot"" Do we not remember that it takes over a month for the entire regime? And at this point in time where the government boasts about over 85% vaccination rate, and the measures never being this extreme in the past yet is such during a time when they say we are making progress, is it really necessary at this very moment?

As Sinopharm was not part of the national programme, it was a lot more inconvenient to get it, but inconvenience aside, it was nearly impossible to during the initial stages because of the overwhelming demand. I am just a student that still has to go to school almost everyday, buy lunch or dinner back occasionally for my family, and go grocery shopping on my way home sometimes. Our way of life is thoroughly disrupted and made nearly impossible to carry out because of the new restrictions. And this all boils down to the fact that our preference was Sinopharm, which causes us to be fully vaxxed later than others. Is it wrong that we had a different preference? If you think it's a sin, then you do you.","Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13 Likely a very unpopular opinion but because I'm part of a so-called minority, just thought I wanted to share a different perspective amidst all the scolding of ""anti-vax idiots"".

Myself and some of my family members are only partially vaccinated so far (one dose or not yet 2 weeks after second dose) because we chose to be vaccinated with Sinopharm instead of the mrna vaccines, simply because we are just more comfortable with the inactivated vaccines that have been used for other past treatments. Say what you will about experts' comments and evidence about the safety of mrna vaccines, I'm no expert to challenge it, but I don't think it's unreasonable to choose a different vaccine that my family and I feel more comfortable with, as opposed to the mrna ones that the majority are taking. It's not even that I don't want to get vaxxed, I just want a different vax. Any take on such a view? 

We don't think that vaccines are ineffective, nor think that it's some chip that government tries to implant in us to track us or whatever. I have also taken other vaccines, such as the one against cervical cancer, so I don't doubt the effectiveness of vaccines in general. It is simply a matter of preference that we chose Sinopharm as opposed to the ones in the national programme, and I don't think it's a luxury to be able to have a choice.

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","To be honest, this rule is a way for them to slow down the spread of severe Covid Cases. It also helps protect those that that are unvaccinated.

I don't think people should be interpreting it as a rule that disadvantages certain people only (ie. discrimination). Treat it as something for your own well being. It's to protect yourself. Even the vaccinated can't be out for long since we can get infected too (or become a close contact). Once we get infected, we'll be stuck at home for a good 10 days - and the probability of getting infected going out right now is pretty high too.

We're all struggling together to be honest. The difference is that the virus really loves picking on weak immunities.

I doubt it will be a permanent rule anyway. Once the virus peaks, it should start to go down as herd immunity kicks in. Hopefully. Delta makes achieving it a lot more complicated though.

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","I am fully in favour of vaccination too, but like this the government is not really being fair to people who work in malls etc. First you report there are no plans to mandate the vaccine, you will just push toward more testing etc, but then you introduce this new measure with only one week's notice. 

Even if people were to get vaccinated after this announcement but are unable to work from home (eg. work in retail), then how? Their employers will let them stay at home for 5 weeks until they can come back? By now, almost everyone has gotten their two jabs and the group affected by this is tiny, but it will make a difference to them and at least they should have the time to make a choice. Whether they are fully vaccinated next week or in 5 weeks time won't make a big difference for the hospitals if they are under 60 given they were unlikely to end up there in the first place.

Yes, it has social repercussions and that is why I agree with the differentiated measures for dine-in and group sizes.

The study was done in Israel when the Delta variant was rampant. 

3 groups of people were in the study:

(1) double vaccinated with no infections,

(2) previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and 

(3) previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals (the hybrid immunity that was raised in another comment).

the conclusion was hybrid > infected with no vaccination > double vaccinated.

The study was done in Israel when the Delta variant was rampant. 

3 groups of people were in the study:

(1) double vaccinated with no infections,

(2) previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and 

(3) previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals (the hybrid immunity that was raised in another comment).

the conclusion was hybrid > infected with no vaccination > double vaccinated.

“Data from COVID-19 tests in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore are showing that vaccinated people who become infected with Delta SARS-CoV-2 can carry as much virus in their nose as do unvaccinated people. This means that despite the protection offered by vaccines, a proportion of vaccinated people can pass on Delta, possibly aiding its rise.”

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-vaccine-protection-less-effective-against-delta-variant/

“The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.”

Also, it seems that the extent of immunity conferred by infection without vaccination [can vary quite significantly between individuals](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/prior-infection-vs-vaccination-why-everyone-should-get-a-covid-19-shot/). Some previously infected persons may well have poorer immunity than uninfected vaccinated persons. Vaccination has more consistent results, so it makes sense to encourage it even among the previously infected.

ETA: That said, someone else has pointed that having recovered from covid is actually recognised as equivalent to vaccination even under the new rules. I guess that strikes a better balance, though I still think the contrary position could also be justified.","Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13 There’s still a benefit to society from giving previously infected persons better immunity than they would otherwise have.

I agree that lack of long term data on mRNA vaccines is worrying as most vaccines undergo years of testing before roll out. I initially chose to remain unvaccinated with mRNA due to the same exact reason but my workplace peer pressured everyone to do it so.... I did it haha 

A few months ago where the covid cases and thus chance of getting covid was low, if one were to remain unvaccinated temporarily and wait for the sinopharm vaccine because it is a more familiar vaccine, I'll say that's an acceptable risk to take. 

But now with the cases being so high, it seems to me that the risk of getting covid and dying from it due to lack of vaccination (according to data from other countries) severely outweighs the benefits of waiting for the sinopharm/risk of mRNA vaccines. 

There is a good chance you (touch wood) might get covid and potentially die from it (touch wood again) and the data overwhelming suggests that vaccinated people don't die as much. So do you think perhaps it might be safer to just get the mRNA vaccine ASAP because the risk benefit considerations have changed over the past few weeks.

50% of people UNVAXXED are in ICU, despite there being only 5%(?) Of the population being wilfully unvaxxed. 

The other 15% being children who can't be vaxxed.

You see how the unvaxxed are disproportionately overrepresented in ICUs? They're the ones clogging up the healthcare system. Causing the government to delay reopening, continuing to keep the economy in a fucked up state, causing widespread depression and increased suicide rates, because at this point living just becomes a slow death for many.

Latest literature shows massive reduction in protection after being fully vaccinated:

“Six months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.”

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114583?query=featured_home


“The researchers said effectiveness declined gradually, starting from the first month after the second dose, accelerated after the fourth month and reached a low level of approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose.”

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-vaccine-immunity-fda-kids-5-to-11/

“The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.”

Who needs the vaccine? The 12 year olds or the 25year olds with ridiculously low IFRs of 0.0027% 0.014% respectively?

So there’s no way to stop the circus with the demonization of “cases”. As these vaccines do NOT provide sterilizing immunity the “wall of immunity” some people are blabbing about is downright impossible. 

""Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar viral loads in communities with a high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant""

“We find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine “breakthrough” infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.”

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/

“Data from COVID-19 tests in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore are showing that vaccinated people who become infected with Delta SARS-CoV-2 can carry as much virus in their nose as do unvaccinated people. This means that despite the protection offered by vaccines, a proportion of vaccinated people can pass on Delta, possibly aiding its rise.”

“The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.”

None of those studies/reports rebut the claim that **vaccinated persons have a lower hospitalisation rate than unvaccinated persons.**

Take the Israeli example, for instance. Wow, 60% of those hospitalised were vaccinated! Pretty bad, right? Wrong: among other things, 78% of over-12s were vaccinated, so that figure instead proves that the vaccine was indeed effective in preventing hospitalisation.

[You can read a detailed analysis here.](https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/israeli-data-how-can-efficacy-vs-severe-disease-be-strong-when-60-of-hospitalized-are-vaccinated) The bottom line is that:

> After accounting for the vaccination rates and stratifying by age groups, from these same data **we can see that the vaccines retain high effectiveness (85-95%) vs. severe disease,** showing that when it comes to preventing severe disease, the Pfizer vaccine is still performing very well vs. Delta, even in Israel from whence the most concerning data have arisen.

As for the point about viral loads, you conveniently leave out [this part of the picture](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02187-1):

> However, vaccinated people with Delta might remain infectious for a shorter period, according to researchers in Singapore who tracked viral loads for each day of COVID-19 infection among people who had and hadn’t been vaccinated. Delta viral loads were similar for both groups for the first week of infection, but dropped quickly after day 7 in vaccinated people.

In other words, though vaxed and unvaxed infected persons can have the same viral load, vaxed persons may show a quicker reduction in the viral load, i.e. there is a shorter period during which they are highly infectious.","Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13 I already rebutted this shit in reply to your other comment, so obviously you are just interested in spreading propaganda rather than engaging in dialogue.

You pasted an opinion/conjecture article that supports your opinion and everything’s else is propaganda?
It’s really disgusting that instead of engaging in a discussion you are behaving like a troll/shill demonizing anyone and anything that you don’t like. 

Here’s my reply in case you missed it: 

The 85% number of this article is derived by conjecture. Unfortunately it’s just wishful thinking. 

Latest literature shows massive reduction in protection after being fully vaccinated:

“Six months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.”

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114583?query=featured_home


“The researchers said effectiveness declined gradually, starting from the first month after the second dose, accelerated after the fourth month and reached a low level of approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose.”

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-vaccine-immunity-fda-kids-5-to-11/

“The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.”

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.21261317v1.full.pdf



Regardless we are saying the same thing though. We still see a really high number of COVID hospitalizations from age groups that needed the vaccine protection more than most. This is the whole essence here. 
Who needs the vaccine? The 12 year olds or the 25year olds with ridiculously low IFRs of 0.0027% 0.014% respectively?

“Across all countries (Figure 3), the median IFR was 0.0027%, 0.014%, 0.031%, 0.082%, 0.27%, and 0.59%, at 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years”

A larger number of individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and higher attack rates would be needed to confirm efficacy of the vaccine against mortality.”

What I can tell you is that kids everywhere are mean. Everyone, everywhere across all ages and countries can tell you times they were picked on, made fun of, or made to feel like the “other”. If they tell you otherwise, they were probably the bully— but I guarantee they were bullied at some point, too. Part of being an adolescent is jockeying for social position, finding out who your friends are, establishing your identity. It’s not a pretty process; Especially when you’re young and everyone is subject to peer pressure. 

Is racism okay? Never! I am just pointing out that kids are ignorant in many cases and just trying to fit in. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and tell them exactly how what they said is racist and how it made you feel. If they are really your friends, they will learn from if and respect your feelings. If not , move on. You don’t want people like that in your life.

Most of what you experienced sounds more like ignorance and bullying rather than ill-willed racism. Take me as an example, I did not know that there are Indians who put coconut oil in their hair. When I walk past an Indian who smells strongly in a scent that I am not usually accustomed to, I would always be thinking ""oh it's that Indian smell"". But that is because, to me, that is the best way to categorize that unusual pungent smell. 

Exert some confidence and voice out your concerns with your friends. Try to educate them. Use this as a litmus test to find out what friendship is worth maintaining. Life is too short to mould yourself into something you are not. And honestly, what do you have to lose? You can also try finding people through interest groups who would accept you for who you really are.

There will always be narrow-minded people who refuse to accept the cultures of other races, and frankly, those people are stupid. So if the only people who exhibit racist behaviors are either ignorant or stupid, why are you letting yourself get affected? Would you be angry at a dog for barking at you?

I am stereotyping here, but I would say that people who are dumb but thinks they are smart, are the worst offenders of racism. Their self-righteousness fuels their believes like nothing you have ever seen. However, those that know they aren't the brightest have always been extremely caring and accepting. This is not meant as a blanket statement, but I definitely believe that the odds are significantly higher.

One last thing, you will always be profiled by others based on your attributes, and that is a fact of life. You will never be able to change that. The only thing you can change is the surroundings you put yourself in, and how must of that ""profiling"" you let affect you. 

p.s. one more thing. Don't keep all these thoughts within you. Talk to your family and friends. All you have experienced so far is the most immature and dumbest part of your entire life. Understand yourself, know what you want, and fuck other's opinions. Good luck.

p.p.s an extra note: everyone has that phase of trying to fit in, thats normal. But that doesnt mean that you should/need to fit in. Others opinions probably seem like a huge deal when you are 16, but its honestly laughable when you grow up. Nothing should matter more to you than yourself (maybe other than family etc...). Live your life the way YOU want. Surround yourself with people who genuinely like you for who you are. Singapore has a problem with racism. That does not mean that you should willingly be subjected to racist behaviors. Confront those racist behaviours that make you uncomfortable.

I’m so sick of it,"Sorry to hear about your experience OP. Some thoughts and reflections as an Sg chinese:

1. Chinese privilege in Singapore is a very real thing. We need to be more aware and call it out whenever we see it. Actually, we first need to admit it exists. 

2. Racism is not binary yes/no. If it is, everyone you speak with will not be a racist , but yet minorities are on the receiving end of microaggressions and overt racism so often. I think it's more important to question our prejudices and stereotypes that lead to certain behavior.

3. When kids behave like shit, it's largely due to their parents. My parents said some pretty racist things behind closed doors back when I was a kid... Agree with other posters that bullying affect all kids but that's conflating different issues together.

4. I've lived as a minority overseas in both English and non-English countries, and experienced overt racism (e.g., heckling on the streets, name calling), microaggressions (e.g., asking me if I use chopsticks to eat pizza, telling me my English is good for a foreigner) and from young kids (e.g., calling me Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan)... This has made me painfully aware of how the minorities in SG are treated, often thru ""innocent"" or ""non-racist"" jokes or comments. You don't have to be ""racist"" to make someone else feel uncomfortable about their ethnicity or race.

I’m so sick of it,"Clearly your fear and anger are valid, but I’d also like to point out that you at 16 write in a self aware manner perhaps superseding the awareness of most of your peers. At that age you cannot expect most kids (yes, kids) to be nice or unselfish to issues not affecting them directly. While how children and teenagers behave are indeed reflective on their upbringing, you still get school bullies who pick on those who are different.

As a Chinese woman living in Singapore for most of my life, obviously I have not had the experiences you had or will have. But like you say, I have run into racism living outside of my own country, and as a woman with more tech/sciencey interests I have faced sexism. While not dismissing your frustrations and obviously you’re allowed to expect more of society — please don’t let this consume you, especially at this age. Politically woke people would tell you to complain and expect more from people, but as you grow up you’d probably learn that inequality however subtle will always exist when you’re different from the majority. Even diversity programs in companies are a sort of reverse racism in a sense, and there will always be people who will pretend to be civil to your face but would never let you date their sons/daughters if it were up to them. If you mess up, their subconscious will jump to attribute it to your difference — because you’re woman, because you’re Indian, because whatever.

So if you were my daughter/son, I would want to tell you to own who you are. Wear coconut oil, do things that make you feel good and proud to be yourself, regardless of race. When people say crap to you, call them out on it politely. It’s not ignoring — but it’s about not losing your cool in face of bullies. Show that you’re above all of this and never put yourself in a position where you’re the victim. That’s how you protect yourself, because you can’t control the actions of others, no matter how frustrating it might be. Don’t let your childhood grow up to just revolve around this.","I’m so sick of it Clearly your fear and anger are valid, but I’d also like to point out that you at 16 write in a self aware manner perhaps superseding the awareness of most of your peers. At that age you cannot expect most kids (yes, kids) to be nice or unselfish to issues not affecting them directly. While how children and teenagers behave are indeed reflective on their upbringing, you still get school bullies who pick on those who are different.

As a Chinese woman living in Singapore for most of my life, obviously I have not had the experiences you had or will have. But like you say, I have run into racism living outside of my own country, and as a woman with more tech/sciencey interests I have faced sexism. While not dismissing your frustrations and obviously you’re allowed to expect more of society — please don’t let this consume you, especially at this age. Politically woke people would tell you to complain and expect more from people, but as you grow up you’d probably learn that inequality however subtle will always exist when you’re different from the majority. Even diversity programs in companies are a sort of reverse racism in a sense, and there will always be people who will pretend to be civil to your face but would never let you date their sons/daughters if it were up to them. If you mess up, their subconscious will jump to attribute it to your difference — because you’re woman, because you’re Indian, because whatever.

So if you were my daughter/son, I would want to tell you to own who you are. Wear coconut oil, do things that make you feel good and proud to be yourself, regardless of race. When people say crap to you, call them out on it politely. It’s not ignoring — but it’s about not losing your cool in face of bullies. Show that you’re above all of this and never put yourself in a position where you’re the victim. That’s how you protect yourself, because you can’t control the actions of others, no matter how frustrating it might be. Don’t let your childhood grow up to just revolve around this.",2029

I feel like racism is solely hate/prejudice based on skin colour.

For your first point where teachers makes jokes in Chinese, I agree that it can be uncomfortable but if we forbid speaking our mother tongue in group settings wouldn't it be very suffocating? I feel like many minorities speak their mother tongue when with their friends as well.

Second point is racism. Fair and fair.

Third point, people tend to perceive things they are unfamiliar with prejudice. But it can happen for a kpop dance or any sort of dance for that matter. A pole dance would also probably get jeered by primary school kids. So it's unpleasant but I don't feel like it's racism.

Once again, unfamiliar. If I brought smelly tofu to the canteen I would get laughed at by my friends as well... Alot of things u mentioned here are things you do actively. It can be suffocating for others if a Chinese goes to class wearing a strong different smelling perfume. And honestly, shaving is really a personal opinion thing. Some people do, some people don't. There are Chinese that can be quite hairy as well and it could well be pointed out by others just like you did. 

I'm using Chinese as an example as they are the majority in Singapore. Of course this is my personal opinion, please do share with me if I'm flawed in my understanding somewhat.","I’m so sick of it Hi OP,

For me, I just try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but I also catch myself generalizing every now and then. 

All-in-all, we are all just a little racist, but we need to try to be better people and not do/say things to hurt someone else. You do you and don't change who you are. Try your best to drown out all the negativity.",660

I’m so sick of it,"Hey I'm so sorry that you experienced what you have.

But I do hope that you can find hope in patience. People's  stereotypes and beliefs don't change overnight, but they do change as each generation grows up.

Our parents' generation grew up without having a common language with other races. They grew up in a period where communities look inwards for help and where that was the only concept of community. Singapore as a nation was in its infancy and even today, we are still trying to figure out what Singaporean really mean. What this probably mean was that anyone outside their familiar concept of community was alien and thus, there was little need to understand them and thus results in racism. Racism stemming from ignorance and not malicious intent, but still racism. 

But one thing I am sure, is that majority of the younger generations do not believe in all those ridiculous racial stereotypes once they reach an age where they can reason. I used to hear stereotypes about the minority races too, from relatives etc. But I don't think any of them are right. What is more important is that I won't pass them on to my kids, and I will educate my kids that these stereotypes are wrong. I hope to believe that there is a silent majority like me out there who will effect this inter generational change.

I hope you can find hope in that things will change for the better. A decade or two ago, it would have been quite impossible for such casual racism or overt racism to be called out. I think it was largely because back then, there was an even lower degree of understanding of what racism really is. We are now aware that what was previously accepted (perhaps due to circumstances of the times when there were other more pressing concerns or simply greater ignorance in society) should not be accepted anymore now that we have grown as a society. The natural next step will be change for the better. I can't see our society ignoring these issues forever when we are already demonising racist individuals online. 

I can't say the same for everyone, but if my kid ever do anything racist, I can assure you that I will be the first to call it out, make sure that my kid learns what is wrong about it and make sure it does not happen again.","I’m so sick of it Hey I'm so sorry that you experienced what you have.

I’m so sick of it,"Thank you so much for sharing and this is exactly why I left 9 years ago and will never return permanently. Singapore is a country where open racism is condoned by the majority. 

Growing up Chinese Singaporean, it’s probably not surprise that I learnt overwhelmingly racist behaviours from my family. All of primary and secondary school I was a part of this phenomenon of “micro aggression”. 

I started to question my behaviour in my late teens but it wasn’t until I left Singapore that I was on the receiving end of racism daily. 

Lived in 3 different countries in Europe since then and I genuinely feel like life as an Asian minority is easier in most of north-western Europe than life is as a South Asian in Singapore.

Similar themes all over the world is that the local majority will: downplay your struggles, celebrate your efforts at being less culturally authentic and make racist jokes with you because they see you as “one of them”.  

What makes life easier for me though, is that in most of the major cities in north-western Europe, people are too worried about being perceived as racist. Openly racist statements and policies aren’t commonplace. 

OP didn’t mention this and probably hasn’t started working yet but in Singapore there are job ads that say “Chinese speaking only” despite English being the spoken language in most places, rental ads saying “No Indians”. As a result, if I stay within the right circles (gentrified neighbourhoods and I work in tech), I can easily go through life without being too bothered by the subtle racism. 

Living life as a minority as been a teaching and humbling experience and has made it difficult for me to go back to being “one of them” back home in Singapore.

Going back to Singapore for me always meant dealing with racist comments from my family. I recall one particularly tense situation last year where I discussed having difficulties with my new manager due to differences in work culture. My words were “I think we value different things at work and I’m really need to understand his working style because otherwise it won’t work out”. My father replied with “Don’t worry we also don’t like Indians. You don’t have to worry about justifying yourself”. I did not respond well to that at all and the rest of the dinner did not go well. 

I cannot change the way I was raised and how my family is but I will do everything in my power to make sure that I do not pass this onto the next generation. All I have been doing so far is to make sure to stop such conversations where I can. It’s unfortunately human nature to discriminate and I don’t think that things will change in my lifetime. 

I am sorry that people like the OP have to grow up in a society that forced them to repressed themselves to fit in. It is my hope that more  Singaporeans become aware that we are not “regardless of race, language or religion”.

I’m so sick of it,"Thank you so much for this OP. I'm sorry you had to feel like this in the country you call home but I believe more minorities speaking up will slowly but surely make Singaporeans more culturally aware. I also hope these conversations will open a lot of people's eyes to the fact that even subtle snarky remarks with no intention of being racist or hurtful, can be racist and hurtful.

As a Chinese who immigrated to Australia at the young age, whenever I'm back in Singapore, I frequently have friends and family asking me, ""aren't people racist there?"" and in my mind, I'm cringing and thinking, yeah, some are, but there's a whole bloody lot of racists here too. I don't understand the disconnect where you're afraid of being a minority and being ridiculed and discriminated against, yet treat others the exact way you don't wanna be treated!!? It's insane!

Having heard remarks from my own family about Indians and darker skinned races, I am always doing my best to educate them and speak out about their discriminatory words and actions and I hope other people are doing the same too! It's devastating that there are Singaporeans who are dealing with this shit in this day and age.. Stay strong OP, I hope you'll sincerely embrace your wonderful culture and be proud of it!! Indians are so lovely and kind, your culture is beautiful and you guys food is bomb af! Racists will always be around but know that there are many people who are rooting for you and all the minorities everywhere. Take care :)","I’m so sick of it Thank you so much for this OP.

I’m so sick of it,"Can't say I ever been to Singapore but I can relate, born in America, son of Indian immigrants, I forced myself to assimilate so I wouldn't get bullied, but it never really worked. As I got older, things got better, but I attribute that to the fact that I got better at blending in. 

I will never forget what one of my classmates said in highschool about another Indian who wasn't as adept at ""fitting in"", he said, ""Man, why can't Raj be like you? People would make fun of him less if he just tried to be normal. You're normal, sometimes I forget that you're Indian.""

I was normal because I repressed my identity, I stopped associating with Indians, I stopped eating Indian food, I refused to learn my parents language, didn't let my parents meet any of my ""friends"" and was constantly embarrassed. All out of shame for what I was.

Let me be crystal clear, the US is not a racist country, in fact, out of any of the countries I've been in, it's been the most accommodating, and I hate the fact that other countries like Canada or the European ones take this moral high ground. You are full of shit, you may like to pretend you are superior, but you're not, and I'd hazard to say that you're worse. At least America attempts heterogeneity, no other white dominant country is even close the ethnic mixing that America has managed to achieve

I’m so sick of it,"Thank you and hugs, OP. You have all right to be sick of it. It's upsetting to see how racism is still very much prevalent here, and how hurtful it can be to people. I hate how all of it is so irrational and ridiculous. And the double standards. The gall one must have to claim that curry is 'smelly' or will 'stink up my house' while durians apparently are 'an acquired taste'. What the fuck.

I've been contemplating on whether to comment or not, but I figured I should give my experiences. I'm half Italian, half Chinese. It is incredibly privileged of me to say this from my end (for instance my own school experience was pretty uneventful in terms of race) but I hate how I've seen how racism and stereotyping manifest (not only negatively but also to a positive end) and has even favoured me over others purely by my own race. I've been given opportunities on basis of being 'ang moh', and somehow meaning I automatically had better English because of my race alone rather than actual ability. Admittedly this was probably in part also due to my accent (being international schooled does that to you) but even before I spoke there was this favouring already in place. Meanwhile, fellow Malays didn't even get a chance. Even in spite of this 'pedestal', people would still mock my accent excessively, even when I told them to stop it. Pasta jokes or doing the 'Italian hand gesture' gets real stale after the 50th time.

I know my experiences don't compare. Even in my NS, I was incredibly fortunate to mostly be around very understanding and friendly people. I can't say I've been actively looked at with disgust or hatred. In the end, I can just simply give a sarcastic quip in return and treat them more like an overly running gag. But experiences and remarks like what you've gone through can cut deep and impact for many long years. This is our home, after all and racism should have no place in it.

I'll close by saying that you are above these fools - so please don't let this consume you, OP - live as you are and be proud for who you are, you are under no compellation to conform to their ridiculous expectations.","I’m so sick of it Thank you and hugs, OP.

These people usually have shallow views about cultures and societies and fail to realize that most of the attitudes that society propagates are normalized. 

Anyway, your experiences are valid and deserve to be addressed. As a minority myself, I don’t deny that it is often difficult to call out instances of casual racism.

Don’t let it stop you from telling them they’re wrong.

The best way to cope with the anguish, at least for me, is to read up about racism itself. Frantz Fanon’s ‘Black Skin, White Masks’ is something that might hit close to home for you. If not, do some casual reading on the internet and you’ll quickly learn that race itself(as a concept or term) is deeply problematic; there being no necessary biological component that determines a person’s race.

I’m so sick of it,"I'm half Chinese and Nepalese and I can fully empathise with how you feel especially with the experiences in Secondary school. During that time I was very self conscious and was ashamed to tell people I was Nepalese as stated on my IC so whenever people asked me what race I was I would just say I'm mixed or Chinese. I remember vividly I had a classmate whom was a PR from India and my physics teacher at the time was discussing with the class what we were going to do for our holidays and she asked him ""When are you going back to India?"" when she jolly well knew that he grew up in Singapore, spoke like a Singaporean, and you would never have guessed he's from India unless he told you. Looking back now it's indeed absurd that she like that lecturer from Ngee Ann poly should know better as an educator who recites the pledge and sings the national anthem everyday alongside students should know better than to groom such kind of behavior... Furthermore a lot of my classmates used to ridicule him and call him smelly as he comes from a religious family and would take oil baths during holy days such as Deepavali which I can tell really bothered him. After I left secondary school and was in poly I just told myself one day that I'm not gonna fucking care how people perceive me anymore and I promised that I will never give anyone the pleasure of shaming me for my race because at the end of the day it's something I can never change. I changed my instagram bio to indicate what race I was and over time I just learnt to be proud of my ethnicity. It's definitely a damn shame that we as a country has one of the highest literacy rates in the world but some still hold these kind of backward thinking. No doubt over time the so called ""boomer influence"" will definitely subside but ultimately it's up to us to educate people and challenge their thoughts about how they perceive other races. Also I feel that people who usually share those racist sentiments are those that have never travelled or lived outside of Singapore (besides Malaysia) so they do not what it feels like to be the minority having to adapt and conform to the cultures of other countries.

I remember vividly I had a classmate whom was a PR from India and my physics teacher at the time was discussing with the class what we were going to do for our holidays and she asked him ""When are you going back to India?"" when she jolly well knew that he grew up in Singapore, spoke like a Singaporean, and you would never have guessed he's from India unless he told you. Looking back now it's indeed absurd that she like that lecturer from Ngee Ann poly should know better as an educator who recites the pledge and sings the national anthem everyday alongside students should know better than to groom such kind of behavior... Furthermore a lot of my classmates used to ridicule him and call him smelly as he comes from a religious family and would take oil baths during holy days such as Deepavali which I can tell really bothered him. After I left secondary school and was in poly I just told myself one day that I'm not gonna fucking care how people perceive me anymore and I promised that I will never give anyone the pleasure of shaming me for my race because at the end of the day it's something I can never change. I changed my instagram bio to indicate what race I was and over time I just learnt to be proud of my ethnicity. It's definitely a damn shame that we as a country has one of the highest literacy rates in the world but some still hold these kind of backward thinking. No doubt over time the so called ""boomer influence"" will definitely subside but ultimately it's up to us to educate people and challenge their thoughts about how they perceive other races. Also I feel that people who usually share those racist sentiments are those that have never travelled or lived outside of Singapore (besides Malaysia) so they do not what it feels like to be the minority having to adapt and conform to the cultures of other countries. I hope that if you're reading this you will know that there are people out there who share your pain and have the same distain as you have for the hypocrites out there. Take care and I hope you have a great rest of the weekend ahead :)",2400

I’m so sick of it,"Hey OP! I'm sorry you had to go through all that and I do hope you are feeling better. I raised this question to another redditor but perhaps it could be something we can discuss too. It may not be that relevant to what you've posted but it's something that has been confusing me due to recent events.

I'll speak candidly about a recent incident. A parody of the gong lady incident was made by an ""influencer"" which was deemed offensive and then taken down. I am one of those who did not watch it, so it leaves me speculating as to what was actually in the video.

In an ideal world, probably no one would have made such a video that would be construed as offensive. As a majority who wants to learn more about sensitivity and empathy, would it be more prudent to leave the video up as an example of what not to do? Of course when it is in the domain of inciting hate and violence it should be taken down, but in instances where it might not be the case, where do we draw the lines to determine if we were to let an offensive material be available?

A main talking point is how we should not shy away from the reality that there is racism, and that we should acknowledge the existence of it and not sweep it under the rug anymore. But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.

So my honest question to a minority would be whether ""cancelling"" an offensive piece of work end up actually causing more harm than intended? Would it be tantamount to not acknowledging the scourge of racism? I'm a majority who sincerely wants to learn more, and because that video has been removed, all I know is that it was racist and not why it was racist. It leaves me to feel that I should not engage a minority for the fear of unintentionally being offensive.

I'm not sure if that is how I want it to be. Should Hanlon's razor be used to never attribute to malice which is adequately explained by stupidity?","I’m so sick of it Hey OP!

Growing up, I was very tanned, looked more Indian or Malay and faced a great deal of racism here. Now that I’m older, I’ve somehow become a bit more Chinese-passing.

People still ask me what race I am, and whether I’m Singaporean. I once had someone ask me that, and then tell me I look Chinese. I was surprised, and told her that people usually assume I’m Filipino, Indian or Malay. She looked horrified... like I had just repeated an awful insult, and was like, “NO LAH!!

I’m so sick of it,"Thought I’d share my story as an Indian immigrant.

I came here when I was 21, earned a pittance. Was hit by racism right away when there was the “no Indians allowed” that most rental ads had at the time. This quite a shock at the time, I had just studied in the US and this was illegal there.

Then comes the usual comments about skin colour, people ignoring you in shops, even my colleagues telling me I would never get anywhere in the company as the management didn’t like Indians (this was the furthest thing from the truth actually). You learn to live with it, nothing you can do.

The only thing that sort of solved this issue was money and status. I did well at my company, the Chinese Singaporean management was amazing and didn’t see race at all. But I’ll be honest most companies aren’t like this, while they aren’t overtly racist, they’re unlikely to promote a Malay or Indian to management level.

With the increase in money and status, racism seemed to fade away. Nobody asked me about race when I wanted to rent a whole condo and the landed place I live in now. I thought racism was coming down in Singapore but that wasn’t it. Status trumps race in Singapore.

Bottom line is, make that dough. Success is the only way to move beyond the lower echelons and get people to treat you with respect. Walk into an expensive shop as an Indian and you may get some funny looks but flash an expensive watch or credit card and see the difference.

This is definitely not the answer you wanted to hear but for now it’s the reality.

However, being successful doesn’t fix everything. We are and most likely will always be an undesirable race in Singapore. I’ll create a new post on my experience on this, thanks for the inspiration. May not achieve anything but it helps to vent.","I’m so sick of it Thought I’d share my story as an Indian immigrant.

Childrens' minds are very moldable, and the ideals we set in them could very well stay with them for a lifetime. The parents that teach racist ideals, were probably exposed to racism at a younger age, and is no part of their psyche. With the digital age, it has kinda become a ""kampung"" of sorts; everyone is free to speak their mind and everyone can freely share themselves. This has helped us flesh out the problems and grievances we have, without fear of retaliation. But many of our older generation don't really know how to access this digital ""kampung"".

Although OP is venting out to many people, it is nothing but a small pocket of Singapore. I feel that in order to really bring out social change, we must be willing to host open meetings (in CCs) with members of differing races and religions, where people are not afraid to share their opinions, regardless of whether they are racist or not.

I notice Primary and secondary school kids tend to be the most cruel as there are no filters. 

Even if you were born Chinese, you would still encounter prejudice. For me, I was of different religion unlike a group of ex-classmates who were Catholic and one day they decided to randomly unfriend me. One even cut out paper crosses and gave it to me for my own protection. 💁 Of course I also tried to fit in at first but stopped giving a fuck as I became older.

However I have also noticed older Indians who dgaf. I had two indian Singaporean ex-colleagues who also brought food with strong aroma and applied some kind of strong smelling indian medicine. No one told them off. For me, I just got used to it after awhile. I also tried to learn the names of the food, medicine.

I’m so sick of it,"I understand these feelings but from another part of the world, growing up Taiwanese among whites in America. I faced the same shame and silent resentment as a child, but growing into my teens I learned to embrace my family’s culture more.

People are racist. Chinese are racist, Indians are racist, Europeans and everyone is racist to an extent. There’s prejudices and preferences and there is so much to be improved there. You should be proud of your people, your rich culture. You can respect and learn the Chinese culture of the majority but you do NOT have to give up your own for that. 

Hold your head up and be prideful of your hair, your cultural wear, your food. One does not have to suffer for the other(as in you can learn mandarin and appreciate trends while still loving Indian things). My friends will be grossed out when I exclaim loving pig intestines (chinese/Taiwanese dish) and I will RUB IT IN THEIR FACE that to me, it is just so juicy in my mouth. I will never let anyone disrespect the things I love about my cultural identity because it is a rich, long enduring lineage of beautiful things(I don’t respect the bad things in it, and those are not things I stand by in my life). 

You’re still young, and there’s a lot shaping you externally. But I can say that Indian fashion is beautiful, the food is absolutely mouthwatering (and I’ve seen similarities to East Asian cuisine that I think a lot of Chinese would also like to eat) and there are really fun festivals/traditions. Instead of hiding this, be open about these with your friends. If they are good friends, they would accept it and maybe be willing to try foods or other surface parts of the culture and be educated before spouting their mouths.

I’m so sick of it,"Perhaps to offer some consolation, I do think there has been a wider appreciation of multiculturalism and progressive mindset. While on the surface, there are still many racist jokes being told (especially amongst the younger generations, looking at you Poly & JC peeps), it is mostly satirical to mock the genuine racist or the more conservative mindsets perpetuated by older generations. 

Now, does that make it okay to make racist jokes just because it’s satirical? No. Of course not. But the humor stems from a disconnect with the increasingly progressive mindset. I do believe in the near future, these jokes would cease to be the social norm. It’s not even appropriate to make racist jokes out in the open anymore but only behind closed doors, which I think is a step in the right direction. 

There’s also a wider level of educated youths being exposed to the internet and various cultures through social media. The exposure and understanding of people different from us is essential to progressive growth. We will get there in due time.

Of course it’s easy for me as a Chinese to comfort you and say, hey it’ll get better. But I think the only thing we can do as youths of SG is to self-educate the importance of social issues and try not to fall into the same pattern of behaviors prior to our generation.","I’m so sick of it Perhaps to offer some consolation, I do think there has been a wider appreciation of multiculturalism and progressive mindset. While on the surface, there are still many racist jokes being told (especially amongst the younger generations, looking at you Poly & JC peeps), it is mostly satirical to mock the genuine racist or the more conservative mindsets perpetuated by older generations. 

Now, does that make it okay to make racist jokes just because it’s satirical? No. Of course not. But the humor stems from a disconnect with the increasingly progressive mindset. I do believe in the near future, these jokes would cease to be the social norm. It’s not even appropriate to make racist jokes out in the open anymore but only behind closed doors, which I think is a step in the right direction.

I’m so sick of it,">I've spent the last decade of my life erasing as much Indian-ness as possible.

>Yes, I don't experience racism every day but I do feel painfully Indian all the time because of the racism I experience every week.

As someone with Indian ancestors living in the Netherlands, I can relate so damn much. It hurts. I'm a 23yo male. All the time I try so hard to not ""act Indian"". All the gddamn time I'm reminded I'm Indian and how much easier it would be living here being caucasian and blonde. It freakin sucks so much. I am definitely moving later, but I have no idea where to. Would there actually be a place where you wouldn't feel like this? I feel like even in India I'd experience this (tho I've grown such a strong feeling against India that I'd never go there anyway). 

I did start caring less the last few years, and I do honestly think the Netherlands is fairly ok, but this post made me go through so much feelings again. Feelings I probably hid the past few years, ignored or just convinced myself they weren't there. 

All I can say is that I hope your children won't have to live through such a hell. We were a bit unfortunate, but I'm hoping our children will have a much better education where the importance of respecting each other whatever race of how wealthy or whatever gender you are, is integrated.","I’m so sick of it >I've spent the last decade of my life erasing as much Indian-ness as possible.

Real talk? The world has always been racist, and will always be. There will never be a moment in time when racism will cease to exist.

What I don't like is when people confine something perceived as a greater sin to ""happening only in Singapore"". Probably not your intention but statements like this trigger me because it comes across as devastatingly ignorant. I will tell you this, shit happens in Singapore all the time, every day, in places high and low. What we see on the news is just a fragment of what really happens, just that most of the stuff is unreported/undiscovered. Also, the shit in Singapore that happens is *far tamer* than what happens in other countries. This blatant lack of awareness of what goes on beyond the country contributes to plenty of ignorant comments on this reddit. They see a mild event here and think its something extreme, and think the worst of this place. They just don't realise the world is pretty fucked up. 

But on to more relevant things, I was good friends with my Indian classmates that I had in JC and in the 2 years with them I can say they are on good terms with my predominantly Chinese class. Your experience is on the opposite end of what they experienced, and I can believe its real, but also that not everyone is like what your perpetrators were. Still, sorry for what you went through, it does scar the one on the receiving end alot no one deserves that.","I’m so sick of it > Singapore always been this racist

I’m a Chinese American who went through childhood has the only Chinese person in my school of mostly white and black kids. Went through life fighting stereotypes against people that hated me, and even some that liked me but still had misguided thoughts on who I was based on what I look like. I was the perpetual outsider and never American enough even though at the time America was the only place I’ve been and English is the only language I knew.

It’s hard to defend yourself against attacks on things you cannot control and are obviously outnumbered on. Most people you meet will tell you you’re overreacting or that you’re too sensitive. Some will tell you that racism doesn’t exist and gaslight you to death. I remember going through life absolutely depressed.

I’m much older now, and I’ve been in Singapore for several years and I get what you’re going through. I see it here too.

If you want to take action, I think a couple of general steps you can take:

1) Speak with your family, hopefully a parent or sibling. They face it at work and definitely have stories to tell. These stories can help you feel less alone.

2) Seek out resources that can educate you about institutional racism, internalized racism, and race in Singapore, hopefully in some non-profit or university. I don’t know the environment here in Singapore but for most Asian kids in America who didn’t grow up in large Asian communities, college is where they learn about all these topics. Try to avoid anything propagandistic on either side.

3) Read “Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria”. More US-centric but should give you some vocabulary to understand what you’re going through. There’s other reading but I can’t remember anything else off the top of my head.

Good luck kid, just know you’re not alone here (or anywhere) and that in 10-20 years these kinds of attacks that feel so impactful now will just be a very small part of your whole experience.

I was buying something while the shop owner (Indian Singaporean) woman was speaking to her employee. A Chinese man walks up to us with a big smile on his face and does the ""anepuneneh"" thing while bobbling his head. That's his idea of humour. The shop owner just smiles sheepishly and tries to let it pass.

So, how would you respond to this situation?

1) Throw him onto the ground

2) Look at him and pull our eyes apart (fighting ""humour"" with ""humour"")

3) Say ""ching a chong a"" (fighting ""humour"" with ""humour"")

4) Laugh at him trying to speak English because it sounds exactly like Chinese (fighting ""humour"" with ""humour"")","I’m so sick of it This just happened a few hours ago at my neighbourhood mama shop.

I’m so sick of it,"totally agree. we are what we are. getting out of reddit is just another form escapism. how long can we hide away from discrimination before we self destruct?

imo, racism is just a form of many types of discrimination... eg, a not so well of chinese kid in a class of well of students would probably dislike rich kids attitude. or a janitor may label uni graduates as elitists.

bottom line is, as long as we are Aware of what are our own Expectations, and Accept what life throws at us, life itself can be much easier (not saying it will be smooth sailing). 

if OP longs to be accepted by others' Expectations, and not be aware of it herself (as to the why), life can be miserable.

The hardest part is the privilege. We get some sort of relief from it, but our friends don’t. And that really sucks so much.",627
I’m so sick of it,"The allure for fair skin hasn't got everything to do with racist attitudes though, although it's true that many old Chinese folks routinely use pejorative terms to describe Indians, like ""orh per"" (black skin in Hokkien) which already sounds very jarring even if one doesn't understand it. 

Actually, in several countries where the majority isn't fair skinned, many women somehow buy the myth that fair skin is somehow desirable and would spend precious money on whitening products. I believe some academic research has been done on this.

This can come with disastrous results: for instance in the Philippines, there have been cases of metal poisoning because of adulterated whitening products.","I’m so sick of it The allure for fair skin hasn't got everything to do with racist attitudes though, although it's true that many old Chinese folks routinely use pejorative terms to describe Indians, like ""orh per"" (black skin in Hokkien) which already sounds very jarring even if one doesn't understand it.

I now understand that the idea was to shift the power balance. Not everywhere, but just enough to protect myself in my little sphere of influence. It was how I survived. The first time I told off a racist person and rallied others to condemn them as well, was when I understood what it was to feel powerful. The racist person was marginalised. Was that the right move? Was I a bully? I dunno, maybe. But I was never afraid after that.

I still face the odd bit off racism every now and then, but I'm less blunt on how I handle it. Maybe I've mellowed with age... I try to educate instead. And I'm glad to say that more often than not, people are willing to listen. For once, I have some hope that we can have an open conversation about racism.

But in a country where 70% of the people is chinese, even if there is an equal proportion of racists to good people in every race 70% of the racists will be chinese hence my post was targeted towards the majority of the racists.   


And you mentioned the importance of evaluating intentions which I agree with. I do it too and I know that when my friends make comments about Indians looking like a gorrilla because we are hairy (for example) its a joke because they move on to another topic immediately and apart from this comment they dont treat me badly. But that doesnt mean that joke was okay. There is a trend these days with people being too quick to cancel anyone who speaks slightly out of line but I assure you the racist ""jokes"" I endure are often completely out of line, just that they are normalised by society hence they can qualify as jokes.  


Given this I also want to say that there are certain situations where these kind of problematic jokes are okay. Within certain friend groups I am fine if my friends joke about things that I would be hurt by if said by anyone else. Person and context matter, if that one friend im super close to calls me shorty ill laugh and call her piggy (for harmless fun) but if anyone im not that close or comfortable with does this I will be very hurt. When in doubt whether your friend is okay with you making certain non-PC jokes, ask them or just dont say it.   


Not trying to attack spitfireviper here or imply that they are racist and wrong, just giving my 2 cents on things too because neither of us can speak for Indians as a whole, these are merely each individuals personal experiences and there's nothing wrong in being cautious not to hurt someone when you dont know what hurts them.","I’m so sick of it I agree with some of what you've, just that my post is merely my own experiences and it just so happened that all the racist incidents I have encountered is from Chinese people.

I’m so sick of it,"Intention isn't really the issue. I think offence can only be taken, not given. The offensiveness of a stetement is determined by the person it offends. We can absolutely take offence with an absolutely innocent statement that was given without the intention to offend. What we have to do, is ask ourselves why the statement is offensive to us. If the statement has implications that belittle or demean other people, then our offence is justified and we should confront the person to help them understand why their statement is offensive. What I'm trying to say is, that it is possible to be offended ""wrongly"". That is, to take offence without justification. It is incredibly difficult to determine if offence is justified because taking offence is usually a very quick emotional response. We hardly have time to trace the origin of our anger before it clouds or judgement. 

So yes, I agree that sometimes, we can be quick to take offence. And sometimes, our offence may not be justified. That doesn't mean that it's OK to make any statement you like. It's not just about the intention of the statement. It's possible to hurt people without intending to. Sometimes our innocent statements may carry subconscious bias that we may be unaware of. And we need to be called out. 

I believe that with open discussion, and respectful sharing of opinions, we can get a clearer understanding of what kind of statements are justifiably offensive, and what kinda of statements are innocent. Finaly, after years of pseudo racial harmony, we are finally asking thses hard questions. We are finally trying to find a way to live together in a multi cultural society. Its exciting, but also scary, because things that were long suppressed are coming to light. We have a long way to go. We have alot of subconscious bias to unpack. We have alot of different opinions to listen to. Hopefully everyone will be heard. And we can come a common understanding.","I’m so sick of it Intention isn't really the issue.

I’m so sick of it,"Hey! Thanks for the insightful comment. I too feel confused from recent events when it comes to drawing lines.

I'll speak candidly about a recent incident. A parody of the gong lady incident was made by an ""influencer"" which was deemed offensive and then taken down. I am one of those who did not watch it, so it leaves me speculating as to what was actually in the video.

In an ideal world, probably no one would have made such a video that would be construed as offensive. As a majority who wants to learn more about sensitivity and empathy, would it be more prudent to leave the video up as an example of what not to do? Of course when it is in the domain of inciting hate and violence it should be taken down, but in instances where it might not be the case, where do we draw the lines to determine if we were to let an offensive material be available?

A main talking point is how we should not shy away from the reality that there is racism, and that we should acknowledge the existence of it and not sweep it under the rug anymore. But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.

So my honest question to a minority would be whether ""cancelling"" an offensive piece of work end up actually causing more harm than intended? Would it be tantamount to not acknowledging the scourge of racism? I'm a majority who sincerely wants to learn more, and because that video has been removed, all I know is that it was racist and not why it was racist. It leaves me to feel that I should not engage a minority for the fear of unintentionally being offensive.

I'm not sure if that is how I want it to be. Should Hanlon's razor be used to never attribute to malice which is adequately explained by stupidity?","I’m so sick of it Hey! Thanks for the insightful comment. I too feel confused from recent events when it comes to drawing lines.

Older Singaporeans might look at your son as a perpetual foreigner, clueless about traditions, and there may be jokes about lacking culture and morals (common stereotypes people have of white people). But these prejudices are majorly trumped by the perceived value of white association.

If you’re within a group where no offence is taken go ahead have a good laugh. But outside that circle it becomes rlly hurtful which is what my post was about. 

I also agree with you saying that there are more racist Chinese only because there are more Chinese people. Minorities aren’t perfect either, many of my Indian family are islamaphobic and some even racist towards Chinese (it’s some sort of messed up coping mechanism they’ll try to make me feel better about any bullying I get by saying things like “ah don’t care when those Chinese kids say you’re ugly their eyes are so small they can’t see you properly anyways “ )

In this instance if you're not in the loop, it appears that the content creator is apologetic while some minorities are very angry.

While true that material may be digested in a harmful manner, another problem presents itself. I personally would feel that outright hateful and incendiary material should not be allowed, but past that where do we draw the line? Would it be somewhat similar as not talking about racial issues?

Interpretation is a tricky thing too, a recent example would be [this comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nxfb7z/celebrity_wedding_in_singapore_circa_2021/) I shared yesterday.

I guess it's really too complex a problem and ideally everyone truly has no malice in terms of content creation or art, thus no work would be construed as offensive, and this wouldn't be a problem.

I agree that there are some risks and that the rewards may outweigh the risks.

If it's content that outright promotes hate and violence it should be taken down.

It's a bit hard to put in words, but because I only saw outrage at the content and the result which was having it taken down and the creator take a hiatus, I would need to err on the side of caution if it was a initial interaction with a minority.

I am genuinely quite sad about it, just like how I feel when I read your account. Perhaps it was because how I have been easily interacting with minorities since young, joining football teams in Primary, Secondary, Pre-University and socially which was dominated by minorities (there's a tinge of sadness I have to differentiate here), the roommate of mine in University from a minority race (again I feel sad to have to make a distinction), travelling overseas with friends from other races and attending each others' weddings and festivities that make me feel this way. 

I now see the privilege I have in that it was not difficult for me to have close minority friends throughout my life. When I think about the current climate applied to the past, would I have these friends in my life? 

But I do have these friends and experiences and I am thankful for that. Do I feel that the advocacy and activism might have been a little too much to make me now feel like maybe it would not be a possibility today? Perhaps.

If even I were to have all these feelings, the ones you talked about would have been greater. I'm sorry OP and I hope things get better for you. Thank you for talking :)","I’m so sick of it Thank you for replying! :)

In Singapore, the Chinese learnt to brush their teeth daily, take regular shower when the weather is hot and put on purfume (English people's stuffs) to make themselves smells nice. 

Instead of wearing Cheongsum or some Chinese attire, the Chinese don western attire at professional and casual setting, adopt western hairstyle and speak English.

Please don't make everything a racial thing. It is a personal choice whether or not to practice your own racial tradition (i.e., apply coconut oil to your hair). Not one is stopping you from doing it. However, you should not take offense at every reaction people had with the smell. The smell is the smell, some people like it, some don't. You can tell them that calling it smelly hurts your feeling and stop them from telling it into your face... But it is unreasonable to use the ""race card"" and forced them to live with something they couldn't tolerate. 

It is akin to saying the western people are racist for criticizing our durian is smelly.

If you are asking for a more historical pov then you are right. When the British bailed on us and Japan took over people suffered a lot so that added up to resentment. Moreover the Japanese treated the white prisoners badly (made them sweep floor etc) which was an uncommon sight because the whites were previously the supreme overlords who people looked up to. It destroyed this concept that the whites were some kind of godly people who are better than Asians which was one of the reasons why when WWII ended and the British came back Singaporeans wanted independence (other reasons was because now they started seeing themselves as Singaporeans and not as Chinese/Indians/Peranakans/etc who are in Singapore for work + other colonies like India and later Malaysia got independence so they want too)

Just some additional comments for potentially more downvotes...

As a Chinese, I have to be completely honest about the stereotype people had on my race and culture. While it may be painful to hear, I can completely understand where they are coming from, and I don't see the need to go all out and bash an entire group of people for their ignorance. What I can do is to change other's perception about \[us\] one at a time and hopefully the representative giants make progress.

I get downvoted for voicing out what's consider unpopular. The Chinese in Singapore has had their fair share of misunderstanding, judgement and discrimination. The Chinese has come a long way and has ditched lots of their old habits and practices to gain acceptance by the world. Have you seen any Singaporean Chinese going around playing victim card saying that the west has made the Chinese lose their cultural identity (Boohoo, brushing teeth daily is so Un-Chinese)? No. Instead it is seen as a progress for the entire population.

Not that I am saying other race or ethnic group should do the same. But, I hope that people can wake up and accept that certain difference among various racial group do exist. When people had some reaction to those differences, let's first assume non-malicious and, if you wish, try to make them understand you.

Nitpicking things that happen several decades ago and use it as a weapon against an entire race group doesn't make you any less racist than those who you complaint about in the story.

The Redditors can downvote me to hell but I will still say; if we continue to promote and encourage such bigotry behaviour, we will not be too far from having a second racial war in Singapore.

That's all I had to say...

What I can do is to change other's perception about \[us\] one at a time and hopefully the representative giants make progress.

I get downvoted for voicing out what's consider unpopular. The Chinese in Singapore has had their fair share of misunderstanding, judgement and discrimination. The Chinese has come a long way and has ditched lots of their old habits and practices to gain acceptance by the world. Have you seen any Singaporean Chinese going around playing victim card saying that the west has made the Chinese lose their cultural identity (Boohoo, brushing teeth daily is so Un-Chinese)? No. Instead it is seen as a progress for the entire population.

Not that I am saying other race or ethnic group should do the same. But, I hope that people can wake up and accept that certain difference among various racial group do exist. When people had some reaction to those differences, let's first assume non-malicious and, if you wish, try to make them understand you.

Nitpicking things that happen several decades ago and use it as a weapon against an entire race group doesn't make you any less racist than those who you complaint about in the story.

The Redditors can downvote me to hell but I will still say; if we continue to promote and encourage such bigotry behaviour, we will not be too far from having a second racial war in Singapore.

That's all I had to say...

It was much much later than I learned what immigration was. That they had a different culture. And that apparently a great deal of people cared a great deal about that.

Senario 2: OP is non Chinese. She is unable to eat beef due to religion. Students make fun of her for not being able to eat beef and tease her about it. Racism much?

Senario 3: OP has no race. She is unable to eat beef because she doesn't like it. Students make fun of her for not being able to eat beef and tease her about it.

The only difference in this 3 scenarios is how we perceive it. It wouldn't matter what race OP was from. The incident has NOTHING to do with race but just the fact that their behevior triggered certain responses.

It is normal for anyone furthermore kids to change their behaviour to fit in the crowd. In this case it was forgoing her traditional food. It's like how OP started shaving?

Im a staunch support of racial equality, and i will not allow any excuses.

It's like getting insulted on Reddit, you don't know anything about me and no one else thinks like you, so who cares? Those idiots don't just talk to OP that way because they're racist, they talk that way because they know enough people around them, and in their country agree with that sentiment.
