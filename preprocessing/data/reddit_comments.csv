"/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 09, 2025","Just wanted to share that I finally tried cycling to the station instead of waiting for the infuriating, unreliable bus.

Somehow, it took me almost twice as long as predicted... 

Maybe it's because I haven't really gotten used to the route yet and I was riding with my basket full of my stuff so can't go as fast. The distance is shorter than to the gym but took 5 minutes longer.

Anyway, arrived quite sweaty but I just tell myself, if waiting for the bus (that's always late) makes me sweaty too, at least I get to enjoy AC earlier.

Best part? It seems I do actually save quite a bit of money. One way costs me $1.20 for a mere 3 minute bus ride! One month is about $20 saved.

Just two problems:

1. I currently just roll up my pants on the right so the gear/chain won't dirty it. I guess no need to buy garters etc.

2. About the [double rack](https://youtu.be/Dok2vaVSilM) thing to lock the bicycle. I tried to follow the steps on the board: pull towards you + push down but the track wouldn't go down? I tried another one beside and same thing. I gave up and just locked at one of the bottom ones.

I will ride back home later after work so fingers crossed nobody is cheap enough to steal my ancient bicycle.","/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 09, 2025 Just wanted to share that I finally tried cycling to the station instead of waiting for the infuriating, unreliable bus.

The mood of this article is: Neutral (sentiment value of 0.07)

United States (U.S.) egg sandwich brand Eggslut has closed its remaining Singapore outlet at Scotts Square after less than four years in operation.

The closure, while not officially announced by the company, was noticed by netizens and shared on online forum Hardwarezone on Mar. 9.

Eggslut had also withdrawn from South Korea in 2024 and Hong Kong in 2025 due to rising costs and changing spending habits in the two countries, according to South Korea news outlet Chosunbiz and South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Singapore outlets removed from website

Eggslut, which launched in Singapore in September 2021, offered egg sandwiches starting from S$11 each.

A photo provided by a reader of what used to be the Scotts Square outlet showed a vacant store, with no closure notice in sight.

The closure of its Suntec City outlet, which opened in December 2022, was also first noticed by netizens in June 2024.

A check on the Eggslut website showed that the Singapore outlets have been removed from its international locations.

At the time of writing, only stores in Tokyo, Japan and London, United Kingdom are listed as the company's overseas outlets.

A quick check on archival site, Wayback Machine, showed both Suntec and Scott's Road outlets being listed as recently as 2023.

Eggslut's Singapore website also appears to be down.

Exited South Korea and Hong Kong

The egg sandwich brand had started to withdraw from its overseas market, starting with South Korea in 2024.

Industry reports in 2023 indicated that the food service industry in South Korea were met with increasing material and labour costs after the Covid-19 pandemic, reported Chosunbiz.

American brands with a ""brunch"" concept also have a ""higher dependency"" on imported ingredients, and were affected with such costs and fluctuations in exchange rates.

The brand also closed its outlets in Hong Kong in February 2025 after less than two years in operation amid changing spending habits by locals and Chinese tourists, reported SCMP.

SINGAPORE: New citizens enrich Singapore and invigorate its economy ‚Äúin ways beyond what numbers can show‚Äù, said Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Mar 9).

Speaking at the Teck Ghee citizenship ceremony at Nanyang Polytechnic, Mr Lee said new arrivals bring fresh experiences, diverse perspectives and global connections.

This helps Singapore to plug into the world and thrive as a regional hub and a global node.

‚ÄúThis is how cities like London, New York or Shanghai become great centres of culture and prosperity. They attract enterprising and adventurous people from all over the world to go there, to live and work.

‚ÄúAnd the steady infusion of new arrivals sharpens them, sparks cross-fertilisation of ideas and cultures, and creates an environment of constant innovation and enterprise,‚Äù he said.

Recalling his visit to Google‚Äôs headquarters in Silicon Valley two years ago, Mr Lee noted that most of the presenters he met had grandparents who hailed from all around the world.

‚ÄúThat is America‚Äôs enormous advantage ‚Äì it draws top talent from every continent, and therefore it can innovate and stay ahead,‚Äù he said, adding that Singapore must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world.

‚ÄúThis is how we became a shining red dot. Because our ancestors came here from many lands, made this their home, and built up this country. And is what we must continue to do, to shine even brighter in future ‚Äì not just for our own sakes, but for our children and grandchildren too.‚Äù

MEASURED AND BALANCED

The Singapore government is ‚Äúkeenly aware‚Äù of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, especially as the inflows are not small either, said Mr Lee.

Every year, there are about 30,000 citizen babies born and Singapore takes in about 22,000 new citizens.

‚ÄúEven dragon year ‚àí last year ‚àí still not quite 30,000 citizen babies born. So we do need to bring in more people, more talent, more contributions,‚Äù he said.

It is therefore crucial for Singapore to manage its immigration inflows carefully by keeping it measured and balanced, said Mr Lee. It is also important to pay close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups and people who are here, and take in people who can fit in and add to society.

He highlighted various ways Singapore integrates its new residents.

All of them undergo the Singapore Citizenship Journey prior to obtaining their citizenship. The Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the People‚Äôs Association also run programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities.

‚ÄúI hope now that you have become citizens, you will participate wholeheartedly in society, and make the effort to integrate,‚Äù he told the audience.

‚ÄúLearn our values and cultural norms, get involved and contribute actively to your communities.‚Äù

""OUR SINGAPORE TEAM""

Mr Lee said other Singaporeans must play their part too, such as by making friends with the new arrivals who may be neighbours, colleagues or schoolmates.

He also encouraged Singaporeans to be ‚Äúbig-hearted‚Äù and welcome new citizens as valuable members of ‚Äúour Singapore team‚Äù.

‚ÄúTo help new citizens to fit in ‚àí to feel at home here, to pick up how our society works, and how we can live harmoniously together. And to firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to our society.‚Äù

Rounding up his address, Mr Lee emphasised how Singapore‚Äôs success has always been built on its people ‚Äì those who came earlier from distant lands, their children born here, and those who continue to join the country every year from all over the world.

‚ÄúAs long as we open our hearts and minds, we can together build a nation that remains vibrant, cohesive, and full of opportunity for those who call it home.‚Äù

First off, Singapore benefitted from the rise of China, as an alternative gateway into the China market to Hong Kong. However, we all know that China's relations around the world are getting strained, and in fact many MNCs have pulled out of the China market into neighbouring Asian countries instead.


Second, we know from Covid, that foreigners indeed take up most of the top positions. When Singapore reopened after Covid, there was an employees' market available which was caused by the void left behind by foreigners who had fled Singapore to return to their home countries.


Third, what other benefits do foreign firms really get by setting up part of their business in Singapore?

A good relationship is when both partners respect and support each other, whether you can afford to eat durians or peanuts after dinner. They build a healthy, strong relationship through mutual understanding and compromise. Even when they are not in the best shape, they are able to make the best of what they have and still find happiness.

What we have now is, the husband is like a pimp, the wife his whore. He lets unmentionable number of men in her, while he collects massive amount of earnings off her. What the men are allowed to do to her depends on how much they are willing to pay.

He finds excuses to justify his causes for allowing this. They live in a fa√ßade of happiness covered by dirty wealth. He convinces himself he's noble, because strange men leave happy, and he donates to charitable causes with that money. Just like how scammers convinced themselves that they create thousands of jobs, in the fight of trying to stop them.

The wife feels abused, betrayed and used, while getting only a fraction of her earnings. She is powerless to do anything because her husband yields too much power. 

There's a ray of light somewhere, when some men and women tried to stand up against him, but he never fails to find ways to put them down, no matter how despicable the methods are.

Perhaps the husband would change for the better, or someone finally overpowers him.

The mood of this article is: Neutral (sentiment value of 0.07)

United States (U.S.) egg sandwich brand Eggslut has closed its remaining Singapore outlet at Scotts Square after less than four years in operation.

The closure, while not officially announced by the company, was noticed by netizens and shared on online forum Hardwarezone on Mar. 9.

Eggslut had also withdrawn from South Korea in 2024 and Hong Kong in 2025 due to rising costs and changing spending habits in the two countries, according to South Korea news outlet Chosunbiz and South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Singapore outlets removed from website

Eggslut, which launched in Singapore in September 2021, offered egg sandwiches starting from S$11 each.

A photo provided by a reader of what used to be the Scotts Square outlet showed a vacant store, with no closure notice in sight.

The closure of its Suntec City outlet, which opened in December 2022, was also first noticed by netizens in June 2024.

A check on the Eggslut website showed that the Singapore outlets have been removed from its international locations.

At the time of writing, only stores in Tokyo, Japan and London, United Kingdom are listed as the company's overseas outlets.

A quick check on archival site, Wayback Machine, showed both Suntec and Scott's Road outlets being listed as recently as 2023.

Eggslut's Singapore website also appears to be down.

Exited South Korea and Hong Kong

The egg sandwich brand had started to withdraw from its overseas market, starting with South Korea in 2024.

Industry reports in 2023 indicated that the food service industry in South Korea were met with increasing material and labour costs after the Covid-19 pandemic, reported Chosunbiz.

American brands with a ""brunch"" concept also have a ""higher dependency"" on imported ingredients, and were affected with such costs and fluctuations in exchange rates.

The brand also closed its outlets in Hong Kong in February 2025 after less than two years in operation amid changing spending habits by locals and Chinese tourists, reported SCMP.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","I think the tough competition in Singapore tends to result many parents and even the children to be narcissistic and more likely to look down on others who are not as talented as themselves. 

Growing up in Malaysia, my schooling days were not as stressful compared to my peers in Singapore. Eventhough I was a laidback person, I still manage to get into the field of medicine in the top university in UK. During my 4th year, I had a chance to select a hospital for my one month elective. I chose to enter cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery department in NUH because it was close to home and NUH is indeed reputable.

I was grouped with 9 other Singaporean students and let me tell you, they were not entirely pleasant. Most interestingly, they loved to show off how fortunate they were in securing electives in countries like US and UK. They scoffed at me for ‚Äúwasting‚Äù my electives by choosing Singapore and not other top hospitals like John Hopkins. Furthermore in every discussion, they always loved to argue with each other and most of the times, no consensus could be reached because everyone was so adamant of their own opinion. I was looked down by others because I did not participate in their confrontation or choose a side.

I did not bother with all their usual banters and arguments but a few incidents showed me how selfish they could be. In one of the early morning, a Chinese old granny was admitted because she had an heart attack a night prior. I was grouped with another 2 girls and our task was fairly simple, we needed to take her history and present the findings in front of our lecturer at noon. The patient was sleeping soundly so I suggested we could come back later when she would be awake for breakfast. The 2 girls wanted to finish it quickly and to my utter shock, one of the girls just went to her bed, shook her shoulders and called out ‚ÄúAuntie! Auntie! We have questions to ask you!‚Äù to an elderly who just had a heart attack! The granny was jolted from her sleep and visibly confused by the sudden intrusion. I felt really bad because she looked weak and tired but she was nice enough to attend to the girls. Another problem arose when we found out she could only speak Mandarin and the girls were bananas so I had to be the one taking history. One of the girls immediate comment was ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they all speak English, so troublesome‚Äù. I was really put off by her remarks. The granny was in a daze so sometimes she could not really answer my questions properly. Due to the fact that the girls could not understand our conversation, they got impatient when they did not get their answers. One girl was like ‚ÄúWhy you so slow, your uni never taught you to take history ah?‚Äù and they snickered among themselves. I was actually more concerned about the granny so I did my things quickly so she could get some rest. I could always come back later when she was feeling much better. I could not understand the mentality of the 2 girls. They were going to be future doctors and to behave such way was just inexcusable. There were many similar incidents even worse but those stories would take up too much time. 

","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student. I think the tough competition in Singapore tends to result many parents and even the children to be narcissistic and more likely to look down on others who are not as talented as themselves. 

Growing up in Malaysia, my schooling days were not as stressful compared to my peers in Singapore. Eventhough I was a laidback person, I still manage to get into the field of medicine in the top university in UK. During my 4th year, I had a chance to select a hospital for my one month elective. I chose to enter cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery department in NUH because it was close to home and NUH is indeed reputable.

I was grouped with 9 other Singaporean students and let me tell you, they were not entirely pleasant. Most interestingly, they loved to show off how fortunate they were in securing electives in countries like US and UK. They scoffed at me for ‚Äúwasting‚Äù my electives by choosing Singapore and not other top hospitals like John Hopkins. Furthermore in every discussion, they always loved to argue with each other and most of the times, no consensus could be reached because everyone was so adamant of their own opinion. I was looked down by others because I did not participate in their confrontation or choose a side.

I did not bother with all their usual banters and arguments but a few incidents showed me how selfish they could be. In one of the early morning, a Chinese old granny was admitted because she had an heart attack a night prior. I was grouped with another 2 girls and our task was fairly simple, we needed to take her history and present the findings in front of our lecturer at noon. The patient was sleeping soundly so I suggested we could come back later when she would be awake for breakfast. The 2 girls wanted to finish it quickly and to my utter shock, one of the girls just went to her bed, shook her shoulders and called out ‚ÄúAuntie! Auntie! We have questions to ask you!‚Äù to an elderly who just had a heart attack! The granny was jolted from her sleep and visibly confused by the sudden intrusion. I felt really bad because she looked weak and tired but she was nice enough to attend to the girls. Another problem arose when we found out she could only speak Mandarin and the girls were bananas so I had to be the one taking history. One of the girls immediate comment was ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they all speak English, so troublesome‚Äù. I was really put off by her remarks. The granny was in a daze so sometimes she could not really answer my questions properly. Due to the fact that the girls could not understand our conversation, they got impatient when they did not get their answers. One girl was like ‚ÄúWhy you so slow, your uni never taught you to take history ah?‚Äù and they snickered among themselves. I was actually more concerned about the granny so I did my things quickly so she could get some rest. I could always come back later when she was feeling much better. I could not understand the mentality of the 2 girls. They were going to be future doctors and to behave such way was just inexcusable. There were many similar incidents even worse but those stories would take up too much time.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","You'll get over the bitterness because it's just the parents, I haven't met too many self-absorbed elitist snobs during my school days (they exist, but are in the minority). Some of these helicopter parents validate their raison d'etre by their offspring's academic achievements, as if the glory belongs to them. I guess you'll have to grin and bear it; service roles aren't fun because Singaporeans live such meaningless existences they derive joy by insulting service sector workers. They've obviously never heard of the mantra ""You can't demand a service while simultaneously demeaning those who provide it to you"".

I came from a neighbourhood background, lucked my way into a top high school, imposter-ed my way into the affliated JC, still managed to disappoint everyone and for me. I just get very bemused when people react to finding out where I spent my high school days skiving off; because to them it represents a distant ivory tower like Camelot (and also that I don't suit the image of success my alma mater exudes), while for me it was just a place where I made decent teenage memories like everyone else. Parents did use that as a point of pride for the first few months when I ""studied"" there, but toned it down after that they realized that I'm the same lazy hoodlum who will continue to disappoint their unrealistic expectations.

Live your teenage years to the fullest, don't let the small mindedness of cynical, jaded adults take that away from you.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","I am very glad your experience sharply highlighted Singaporean's bad culture - elitism and superiority, which prompted you to write this post to further raise more awareness among redditors in SG.

But unfortunately, our bad culture is not limited to just which school ""my child"" is attending, it is everywhere. Some common unfounded basis for discrimination includes jobs, nationality and race.

We typically tried to ignore labour workers, such as bus driver or cleaners. Just recently, I have a Singaporean friend marrying a foreigner and the parents commented that it is a ""downgrade"". This friend, at around 30 years old, said on a separate occasion that she will never allow her children to marry another race. (**Note**: These are my observations, not my actions. I am stating these as examples of discrimination that are still happening in Singapore, please do not downvote because of these examples. I voiced my dissent at the time of these instances.)

So let's challenge ourselves to take actions to be more accepting of others. Smile and slightly nod your head down to bus drivers, cleaners and any person who serves you, or even better say ""thank you"". Remove the mentality in yourselves that human can be segregated by any labels - schools, nationality, race or gender.

For OP, it will take courage on your part to reject being labelled. Coming CNY your relatives will be asking which school are you going to, and then sound their approval (or disapproval). Take it upon yourself to ask them what is their opinions and have an objective conversation with them. At the start of your JC, there will be orientation and there will be far fewer students from other ""neighbourhood"" schools, take it upon yourselve to really interact with them and discover their individual characters and strength as a normal friend.

Bragging 'I'm from XXXX school and you're not so you're fucking stupid' is like saying 'I read more book titles than you so I'm automatically better and smarter than you fucking peasants'.

Talent and hardwork have been put together in SG as correlated, but in truth talent means nothing when it comes to education. A higher grade in education means you have more info than others, not a higher brain function. A man with As in school is just as likely to be treated as a local idiot simply because he's flaunting about a merit that he got by sitting at a table and repeating the same fact again and again.
 
To say 'my kid is from XXXX school because he studies sooooo hard and goes to tuiton EVERY DAY EVERY NIGHT' is like saying 'I want my child to suffer and be deluded with matching actual intelligent worth with memory retension while suppressing their true talents so that I can brag to everyone that I can produce things that aren't pieces of trash'. It's goddamn toxic.

Good on you for speaking out, hopefully our deluded predecessors doesn't use a mob mentality to try and discredit you. You're doing great work.",1338

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","Yeah I made this observation some time back when I was working as a customer service for a call centre. Had one customer called me a good for nothing, shame to my parents and that I will end up working in a call centre for the rest of my life because I was a loser. I shortly quit the job the following week because I just couldn't handle the verbal abuses and personal attacks that I would sometimes get over the phone. Trust me, Singaporeans are 100x nastier over the phone to customer service than in real life. We are passive-aggressive like that.

Around the same time, I was doing my undergrad in a private uni. When people ask me what I am doing for my uni, the moment I said ""(insert private uni)"", you can literally see the sparkle in their eyes die off and they just lose immediate interest in you as a human being. It is disgusting as hell.

You are not judged based on the inner substance and moral values that you have got as a person. You are what your school is. I find this extremely ironic because I came from a top secondary school and JC. At that time, I was treated differently from when I was doing my undergrad even though nothing in me has changed. I remarked to my dad that people treat me differently from when I was in undergrad and now that I am doing my postgrad overseas. I swore to myself that I will NEVER be like that, ever. Because I know how it feels like to be made to feel inferior.

The same thing happens on online, you see people mocking private uni students etc. The kind of superiority complex that some people have about their education baffles me.

The level of education shouldn't matter in our day to day interactions. What matters is that we should treat everyone with equal respect and dignity, regardless of their education and social status. But sadly, I know for a fact that in Singapore, your social status is pretty much determined with your familial wealth or the schools you go to.

But to be fair, because of the lady who verbally abused me, she gave me the extra motivation that I needed to get to where I am today. I work fucking hard every single day to prove that private uni students can excel in life. Fuck you, Sarah.","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.

From my personal experience, people are sensitive to salesperson/sales assistant/promoter. And sometimes they look down on salespeople. Or sometimes they are just purely frustrated with their personal situations (which has nothing to do with you) and are just using salesperson to vent their frustration.

Speaking from my personal experience, I develop and sell my software (SaaS) for a living. And I encountered what you mentioned, just that mine is over the phone (cold call). Some of my friends who do insurance sales for a living, shared similar stories. 

Yours is different in the sense that they approached you, while salesperson approach them. Not entirely similar but the experience I feel is similar. Because I had also been a chocolate promoter with FNA (Cocotree).

I think they look down on salesperson / sales assistant because they think in every way they are better than sales people. I don't know why or what made them think so highly of themselves. They, I mean prospects, treat me better when they know more about me, and especially when they hear more about my credentials and some of the companies that I worked with... Then they treat me with a little more respect.

I never let my ego get in my way. I choose to develop and sell my software for a living. Previously, I was doing a technical (non- external client facing) job like database analyst/software engineer. So I saw how my former colleagues treated salesperson (not too bad but can be better). I always try to treat sales person / promoter with more respect since I was once a chocolate promoter and now a software salesperson.

Anyway customers are King! Perhaps, swallowing your ego and continue to serve them well with a smile. This is what a Taiwanese waiter (I was impressed by his service) taught me. The #1 rule in Taiwan and Japan service industry, he said. Unless they get verbally or physically abusive.

Your experience will shape you to be more humble in life, and more successful. I trust you will.","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student. Nice discovery there /u/kloimo

personally I have not been on the receiving end before, but I fully agree with your opinion that such superficiality should not be the way to go. there are many layers to a person and what one scores in an examination or what they do for a living should definitely not be the sole metrics we use to define a person. 

on our part as the younger generation, we must understand where these parents are coming from. most of them come from a time where a lot of emphasis is placed on education and attaining high academic qualifications. ingrained in their minds is the perception that all students who can achieve good grades are also at the same time good people. unfortunately, this is not the case today. the paper chase today is no longer the only focus of students, nor is the opinion that ""only smart people are good people"" necessarily true today. I say I am heartened upon reading this because many of us, the younger generation of today, understand that a good heart is equally as important as a good mind.

do not get me wrong, I am not justifying the described observation nor am I playing the moral high ground and saying that we are better than the older generations. we most definitely are not; we still have a lot of learn and lots of room for improvement. but I feel this self-awareness is a good start to what we can possibly be in time to come, and because of this I am hopeful for the future.","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student. don't usually post or comment but I feel very heartened upon reading this post and simply had to comment.

Hijacking OP‚Äôs post here... 

And what happens when you tell a person from low SES you‚Äôre going into a top JC? They tell you to be humble and not brag about your place in an elite school.

I was working as a cashier at a supermarket and although the supermarket was located in a relatively more wealthy area, the cashiers were mostly aunties and uncles who have worked there for perhaps more than 5 years and were ‚Äúseasoned workers‚Äù. There were also a few younger workers whom I got the chance to talk to and were more open with sharing their opinions with me.

I didn‚Äôt immediately quit after JC started(jc 2 now), and worked on the weekends, but basically everyone knew which school I went. On my last day, this guy, who was also working as a cashier and just recently finished his poly, told me ‚Äúeh bro, remember stay humble ah‚Äù. I nodded and, well, quit.

At that time I merely thought it was a passing remark, or that that guy is just too opinionated to tell me how to live my life, but recalling back the remark now, and also linking it to my experiences with people of higher SES has shown a difference between the mindset of these people. 

A person of high SES would scoff at you for being ‚Äúlow class‚Äù but treat you with equal respect as they would want others to treat their offsprings when you‚Äôre what they consider ‚Äúequal‚Äù to their children. On the other hand, a person of lower SES would frankly tell you to keep your chin down in order to survive in society, regardless of whether you are high or low SES, as they merely want the best for you, or just a piece of advice from what they might have experienced. 

On one side one is self-absorbed, and always aiming for the best, when they already have the best. While on the other side one is self-directed, and treating everyone the same way.

unfortunately this type of attitude is very prevalent, not only among the 'elite' who look down on others, but to some extent among the middle class, who are insecure about not being elite and can sometimes end up being more mean than the 'elites' themselves.

my family is firmly middle class, and while my parents aren't outrightly snobbish i still get very frustrated with them sometimes. there's the very singaporean obsession with white collar jobs being 'better' than technical or more blue collar work. for example my dad used to make snide remarks about footballers or entertainment figures like singers being 'not smart' and having 'not gone to school a lot'. 

and eventually when i started my own career i chose a more technical field that didn't really 'make full use' of my university degree. while my parents did not object my mum would always find the chance to ask me if i was thinking about changing jobs, or if i would have the chance to expand my job scope to include more intellectual stuff. really annoying.","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student. thank you for sharing! you have a very mature and sensible head on your shoulders!

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","Yeah poly = Polytechnic

Broadly speaking, going to University is much easier from the JC route as the entry requirements are generally more skewed towards the JC kids but now the Govt has helped to somewhat level the playing field in a way with the introduction of Universities that largely admit polytechnic students such as SIT and the programs in SIT aren't much different from the local universities either. 

There's also a growing trend of people who score well enough to enter a good JC but choose to enter polytechnic instead because of a variety of factors. For one, I choose to enter a poly despite being able to make it to a 9-point JC as I felt that poly would suit my learning style better and I wanted to follow my passion. If anyone is doubting is poly people can make it, I'm now in one of the 3 local unis studying computer science so yeah, with enough hard work and effort, anything is possible. 

So I guess it really comes down on what a person hopes to achieve and what route he/she wants to take. There used to be a stereotype that poly kids were 'dumb' but I don't think that stand true anymore given that there are now poly courses that only admit you if you have a near-perfect score in the 6-8 range.

Even as a medical student, you have to clarify and fully explain your intention before carry out any history taking or examination. We also require patient's consent before we could proceed. Compared to Singapore however, I find the local medical students here tend to be aggressive when handling the patients. Most patients here do not realised they could decline the lecturer/student's request and are often pressured to be examined. The medical students in NUH are impressive when it comes to medical knowledge but they do not possess the necessary soft skills and empathy when talking to a patient. From my observation, they tend to be clockwork in their questioning and often fail to realised when said patient is uncomfortable. Even some of the qualified medical professional are not exempted from such behaviour. During ward rounds, the doctor in charge would take the patient's chart and discuss extensively about the patient's disease without acknowledging the patient in front of him. I could feel the patient's uneasiness as his medical history is shared among the students and patients nearby without his consent. Sometimes patients are reduced into case history and statistic rather than a human being. Often in discussion, they would address patients by using their diseases rather by their name. In UK, we would get into huge trouble if we do not respect the patient's wishes but not much in Singapore.  

If you are planning to do elective in Singapore, you need to be wary about the competitiveness of local medical students. Due to limited patients in the ward, the students can get territorial when searching for interesting cases. In my group, there were some students voluntarily withheld information by asking the patients not to speak to other students besides themselves. I think it was selfish and insanely childish for people to keep interesting cases to themselves. I did not hang out much with the local students in my group and instead I joined with the international students. Most international students also expressed similar concerns like mine so we ended up became best buds throughout the whole elective although we were from different departments.   

One thing I do like about NUH is their teaching sessions. They hold a lot of seminars in the hospital and everyone including the doctors is encouraged to join the seminars. They have discussion on interesting cases, new procedures and techniques, drugs, etc. You could even join seminars that do not belong to your department.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","'Objectively wrong' is more of your own opinion, seeing that I made opinionated points on my own interactions with parents that seemed to only have the best interests of their own pride in having 'elite children' that appear to only be able to read from a book slightly better than others. To say that I am 'Objectively wrong' would mean that my 'Objective' of stating on the simple fact that there are talents that require no form of education is complete bullshit, because apparently everyone is a braindead retard until they realise their 'place in life'. Guess what? 

The 'obvious that there are people lack the aptitude to excel academically' and 'the average student in an 'elite' school is almost definitely more intelligent' are some of the most pretentious things I've ever heard in my entire life, and yet I am willing to admit that that the former is half true, but I will stave off my critcisms for the latter after.

For the former, what you are looking for is 'people who are unable to excel in academic thinking and memory retension', seeing that common sense is something that can never be tested nor graded. You are correct that some people are lacking in such mental faculties and I concede that you are correct in that case. But what you are incorrect, which I full-heartedly you do not push off with the pretentiousness of a prideful parent, is that 'excelling academically is the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY OF SUCCESS'. 

'There are many in the elite schools that do not rely on route learning'. If we want to play strawman then I can play strawman too, but this is such a basic defensive line of playing the devil's advocate I am just going to make a simple response; it doesn't matter. The parents are the problem, not the students. I couldn't give two shits if the kids get As or Ds. I care if the parents mistreat other kids IN FRONT OF ME AND THE DAMN KID SIMPLY BECAUSE THE KID IS UNABLE TO AFFORD THE DAMN MONEY TO PAY FOR TUITION. That isn't goddamn human behavior. That's demeaning to both the kid they are heckling AND their own kid, since it shows them that they are only worth as possessions in the adults eyes.

Can you imagine someone, who claims to love you, beating you regularly every day simply because you didn't get a A1 when you got an A2? Beating you because you hate Physics but they force you to take triple science anyway, and mentally conditioning (which is fucking brainwashing mind you) them to think that it's FOR THEIR OWN GOOD? And then realising, after exploring the world and making friends in other countries, or exploring the internet and meeting all kinds of people, that the kind of life you're living is a fucking joke? Can you imagine being in their place? 

Of course not. Every life is different, but EVERY LIFE IS EQUAL.

As for the latter, I couldn't even begin to explain why school=/=intelligence, or how your pitiful defense of ""by conventional definitions"" has about the subtlety of a giant conducting espionage. But I know that you will just brush me off as someone who doesn't understand the 'beauty of the education system' and that I am just a waaaaay too sympathetic strawberry jackass'. So I'm not going to take the bait, and simply ignore that last sentence.

I will not catagorise you into a niche that you will vehemently object to. But do understand that by saying someone is 'objectively wrong' is a direct spit in the face to anyone who has witnessed this kind of suffering.

Let me put it this way, to end it off. 

When I was in Primary School, everyone was the same. When I was in Secondary school, the Primary School friends who got into the 'elite schools' DISAPPEARED for four years. 

When I got into JC and later met them for outings, they had completely changed. I don't know what the fuck their parents and the system did to them; they were angry, quiet, and they seemed to react to any person poking fun at them by lashing out at them. But now, after a year out of JC, and I see that they have completely isolated themselves even from their other schoolmates and secluded themselves to what I can only assume their parents consider a 'better studying atmosphere' or whatever kind of bullshit they say to avoid saying 'conditioning chamber', I can tell you now.

They aren't my friends anymore.","A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student. 'Objectively wrong' is more of your own opinion, seeing that I made opinionated points on my own interactions with parents that seemed to only have the best interests of their own pride in having 'elite children' that appear to only be able to read from a book slightly better than others. To say that I am 'Objectively wrong' would mean that my 'Objective' of stating on the simple fact that there are talents that require no form of education is complete bullshit, because apparently everyone is a braindead retard until they realise their 'place in life'. Guess what? 

The 'obvious that there are people lack the aptitude to excel academically' and 'the average student in an 'elite' school is almost definitely more intelligent' are some of the most pretentious things I've ever heard in my entire life, and yet I am willing to admit that that the former is half true, but I will stave off my critcisms for the latter after.

For the former, what you are looking for is 'people who are unable to excel in academic thinking and memory retension', seeing that common sense is something that can never be tested nor graded. You are correct that some people are lacking in such mental faculties and I concede that you are correct in that case. But what you are incorrect, which I full-heartedly you do not push off with the pretentiousness of a prideful parent, is that 'excelling academically is the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY OF SUCCESS'. 

'There are many in the elite schools that do not rely on route learning'. If we want to play strawman then I can play strawman too, but this is such a basic defensive line of playing the devil's advocate I am just going to make a simple response; it doesn't matter. The parents are the problem, not the students. I couldn't give two shits if the kids get As or Ds. I care if the parents mistreat other kids IN FRONT OF ME AND THE DAMN KID SIMPLY BECAUSE THE KID IS UNABLE TO AFFORD THE DAMN MONEY TO PAY FOR TUITION. That isn't goddamn human behavior. That's demeaning to both the kid they are heckling AND their own kid, since it shows them that they are only worth as possessions in the adults eyes.

Can you imagine someone, who claims to love you, beating you regularly every day simply because you didn't get a A1 when you got an A2? Beating you because you hate Physics but they force you to take triple science anyway, and mentally conditioning (which is fucking brainwashing mind you) them to think that it's FOR THEIR OWN GOOD? And then realising, after exploring the world and making friends in other countries, or exploring the internet and meeting all kinds of people, that the kind of life you're living is a fucking joke? Can you imagine being in their place? 

Of course not. Every life is different, but EVERY LIFE IS EQUAL.

I've come across doctors who excuse or even encourage such behaviour too. What you described in your first post is rather shocking to me though, not that I'm doubting your account, but perhaps because I've not been in the wards for long enough to personally observe anybody being so rude and selfish! (Tbh, I somewhat wish you had told them off for their behaviour and refused to converse with the poor granny on their behalf lol. but I understand that you wouldn't have wanted any conflict either). I think there's a vast spectrum of personalities amongst students and I rly hope I don't come across as defensive, but just hoped to reassure you that the people that you were unfortunate enough to be grouped with during your elective aren't representative of local med students as a whole! personally, amongst the batchmates & seniors i've been grouped with so far, we share the same policy of always waiting for the patient to be awake even if we have to come back multiple times and find the patient asleep every single time. we also forgo our chance to examine patients with rare conditions if we realise that many of our batchmates/seniors have disturbed them already. That being said, I don't know what the majority of students are like, and I certainly wouldn't know about how it's like 'compared to doctors in Malaysia/UK' as I haven't had any electives yet (but for the few UK-trained doctors I've observed so far, i've always liked how they treat their patients). 

It makes me wonder though, whether pressure (from peers/tutors/deadlines/etc) eventually cause some students to abandon the priorities & principles that they originally had, or whether they were already selfish to begin with? If it's the latter, then maybe the admissions process is still very much flawed, but if it's the former, what went wrong along the way? :/ Perhaps a vicious cycle of ""monkey see monkey do"" also contributes to this. E.g. i suspect that some students think it's ok to wake sleeping patients up because they see doctors/nurses do it so often. But they forget that the context is different because they aren't contributing to the care of those patients, so they shouldn't be disturbing them. And it's worse when it comes to behaviour that is borderline unethical, but becomes acceptable just 'cause ""I saw Dr So-and-So do this before, so it must be fine for me to do the same.""     
I sure hope that this won't happen to my friends and I despite the stress, but being human, i'm sure we will face the same temptation at some point. So thanks for your post - it's a good reminder for me to consciously watch what I do and always always put myself in the patients' shoes, before the stress tempts me to do differently :)

Lastly, to everyone who comes across this comment - it's your right to say no to a medical student who wants to discuss your condition/examine you, please don't say yes just out of pressure! We wouldn't want to unknowingly cause you further distress - although we see many patients in the hospitals day in day out and it may thus be tempting to think of being hospitalised as a small issue, when we stop to think about it, it would be a significant event to each patient . Of course, saying no nicely would beat saying no fiercely, we're all humans... :P And of course if you are really alright with it, then we really appreciate it!! every learning opportunity helps us to be a better doctor in future :)

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","Top tier arguments dude.

>'Objectively wrong' is more of your own opinion, seeing that I made opinionated points on my own interactions with parents that seemed to only have the best interests of their own pride in having 'elite children' that appear to only be able to read from a book slightly better than others. To say that I am 'Objectively wrong' would mean that my 'Objective' of stating on the simple fact that there are talents that require no form of education is complete bullshit, because apparently everyone is a braindead retard until they realise their 'place in life'. Guess what? 

No you didn't. You made general statements that 

1) it's not cool to brag about education because people can achieve it given enough time 

2) people with good grades are muggers and had grades beaten into them 

And when you got called out you changed your stance to ""I can't be objectively wrong because I'm stating an opinion"" and why did parents come into the picture? 

Anyway let me address your arguments. 

1) I agree that it's not nice to brag but usually it's the parents rather than the kids that are doing it. As for the latter part, this is objectively wrong as the other person has pointed out. Firstly, not anyone can achieve a given academic qualification given enough time. Secondly, even if they could, it also shows that they are less competitive/able than someone who could do it quicker. A company is not going to take a chance on Bob who took 20 years to finish his CS degree. His knowledge is probably obsolete. Either that or they pay him as much as a fresh grad at 50 years old. How's he going to retire? 

Now obviously there are people who due to circumstances beyond their control couldn't get good grades in school. But there are also people with inferior cognitive and analytical capabilities than others. That's why we have EM3 streams. Of course there will always be false positives but that's how life is 

For (2) it's easy just look at universities. Clearly some people are getting perfect CAP and their parents clearly aren't beating them at that age. 

3) talent is irrelevant to getting good grades 

I attended the GEP in secondary school. Many of my batchmates got 7-9 A1s without tuition, beatings or working particularly hard (playing starcraft/MMOs through exam period). 

Similar observations in JC although coursework is more challenging. Many people mug like hell and perform worse than other people who don't study much.

Yeah there are talents in every sector not just academic. Musical talent, photography, art, etc. A lot of it is aptitude but effort can make up for that, just like in academics 

>The 'obvious that there are people lack the aptitude to excel academically' and 'the average student in an 'elite' school is almost definitely more intelligent' 

I'd be willing to stake a bet on the latter based on career earnings, IQ scores etc. Whatever metric you propose. 

>But what you are incorrect, which I full-heartedly you do not push off with the pretentiousness of a prideful parent, is that 'excelling academically is the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY OF SUCCESS'. 

Nobody is saying that. You are pulling this out of nowhere. 

Anyway just to address that, success has so many definitions anyway but let's just assume that having a comfortable income = success for the sake of argument, then excelling academically is by no means the only possible way. However it's probably the shortest and easiest path.

I don't know if being beaten for getting A2 or having to pay for your own tuition is a true story. It's certainly nowhere near normal and I have never seen anything like it in my school experience.  But it doesn't support any of the arguments you have made.

In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism and anarchism (anarcho-communism), as well as the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution. 

The two classes are the working class‚Äîwho must work to survive and who make up the majority within society‚Äîand the capitalist class‚Äîa minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production.

The revolution will put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution. 

The two classes are the working class‚Äîwho must work to survive and who make up the majority within society‚Äîand the capitalist class‚Äîa minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production.

The revolution will put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","From what you are saying, it seems like you have had a bad experience with elite school students using their membership to brag to you despite your having better objective results. 

Seriously fuck those guys. They are hanging on to their elite school membership because it's really all they have (you got better grades). 3-5 years from now no one will even care where you came from, your work experience and university will be far more important.

There are assholes like this later on in life as well. You get the hotshot trader/VC guy who brags about how much he makes/gets laid/parties, the mercenary doctors, the guy who took over his dad's company and humblebrags about his supercars, etc. I feel like success is really reaching nirvana of self contentment and giving zero fucks about whatever others think.

I do agree that I had a realitively smooth sailing path academically but I don't think the streaming system is the problem. It was like this 20 years ago  and is still like this because half a generation down parents are still embracing the same ideas. Hopefully in another 20 years things will change.

That being said there are going to always be people trying to put down and diminish others. Quite often that's just to make up for their own parents refusing to acknowledge their achievements. For example, your peer may be getting shit from his parents for his shit grades despite being in an elite school and it hurts him deeply hence he needs to feel better by telling you how bad you are. Hopefully that makes you feel better

> The Ministry of Health said on Saturday (Oct 9) that this is a move to protected unvaccinated individuals in the community and to reduce the strain on the healthcare system.

> The ministry said that epidemiological investigations have identified food and beverage (F&B) settings such as hawker centres, retail establishments, and shopping centres as settings frequently visited by a significant proportion of Covid-19 positive cases, including those who are unvaccinated, and who later fell very sick.

> Currently, groups of up to two fully vaccinated people are allowed to dine in, and children under the age of 12, recovered individuals, and unvaccinated people with a valid negative pre-event test (PET) result can be included in the group of two.

> The new rules, which is an expansion of the current set of rules that will kick in on Oct 13, would mean that only groups of up to two fully vaccinated people will be allowed to dine in at hawker centres or coffeeshops, MOH said.

> ""Individuals who do not meet the above criteria can still buy takeaway food,"" it added.

> The new rules, which is an expansion of the current set of rules that will kick in on Oct 13, would mean that only groups of up to two fully vaccinated people will be allowed to dine in at hawker centres or coffeeshops, MOH said.

> ""Individuals who do not meet the above criteria can still buy takeaway food,"" it added.

> Large, standalone supermarkets are exempted from this requirement, MOH said.

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","98.4% of cases have minor or zero symptoms. This means nearly all who catch covid  recover and keep living, indeed they gain natural immunity which is being proven to have much greater prophylactic value than any vaccine in the face of future contagion. 

There is no value given for the vaxxed vs unvaxxed ratios of asymptomatic covid at MOH. If you find it, please share. The good news is that nearly all who get covid recover, it would be helpful to know what ratio of vaxxed to unvaxxed is in that 98% (does it proportionately represent the the ratio of total vaxxed population? ). 

Of the remaining 1.6% infirmity is 50/50 Vaccinated vs unvaxxed, thus the argument that only unvaxxed are a burden on the healthcare system is an exaggeration,though the case that unvaxxed are over represented and overly burdensome in ICU is valid. 

With a hypothetical 100%vax rate, 100% of icu visits and deaths will be vaxxed individuals (vs the 30% vaxxed deaths currently), the vax does not give immunity. Isolation of unvaxxed to their homes should skew the forward numbers more in the direction of vaxxed being the burden on the healthcare system and give a truer overview of the prophylaxis of mrna vaccines. 

Regarding deaths, I cannot find a summary of vaxxed vs unvaxxed deaths since vaccination started nor since herd vaxxed rate was achieved, this would be useful. On the daily reading of MoH stats 4/6 recent deaths were vaxxed 2 unvaxxed, age and comorbidity were factors. 

Seperately and for cinsideration of preventable deaths, Singapore has over 2200 smoking related deaths per year (thus 142 covid deaths and 4400 smoking deaths since covid emerged in Wuhan) yet cigarettes remain on sale and smoking legal.. The impact of reducing deaths through eliminating smoking would of course not be seen for decades but is worth considering as second hand smoke also contributes to lung health issues in society. 
Restrictions on sugar would also reduce death from diabetes. Diabetes kills nearly 4400per annum (thus 8800sonce covid broke out).

What about those who've gotten covid and recovered? Why do they need to get vaccinated? Many studies have shown that immunity from getting covid is better and more robust than from the vaccine. If they do not feel comfortable injecting something into their body, I don't think it's reasonable to force them this way to get vaccinated, when it's not only less effective than what they have, but also goes against their personal right to choose.

Myself and some of my family members are only partially vaccinated so far (one dose or not yet 2 weeks after second dose) because we chose to be vaccinated with Sinopharm instead of the mrna vaccines, simply because we are just more comfortable with the inactivated vaccines that have been used for other past treatments. Say what you will about experts' comments and evidence about the safety of mrna vaccines, I'm no expert to challenge it, but I don't think it's unreasonable to choose a different vaccine that my family and I feel more comfortable with, as opposed to the mrna ones that the majority are taking. It's not even that I don't want to get vaxxed, I just want a different vax. Any take on such a view? 

We don't think that vaccines are ineffective, nor think that it's some chip that government tries to implant in us to track us or whatever. I have also taken other vaccines, such as the one against cervical cancer, so I don't doubt the effectiveness of vaccines in general. It is simply a matter of preference that we chose Sinopharm as opposed to the ones in the national programme, and I don't think it's a luxury to be able to have a choice. 

The problem is, people who follow the news might know that Sinopharm arrived in Singapore only in late Aug to early Sep, and the days following its arrival, you might also have seen news about the high demand and overwhelming response for it. My family members and I made appointments with multiple providers of it but to no avail because appointments were booked so quickly that I wasn't quick enough to be part of the first batch to receive it. My second dose is in slightly under a week, meaning that it would be about 3 weeks before I'm counted as fully vaxxed. I can accept the dine-in restrictions, and while it means some inconvenience or not having the occasional luxury of dining at certain establishments, it does not exactly affect my way of life. But to restrict entry into malls, means I cannot takeaway food from anywhere but hawker centres/coffee shops or standalone outlets - which are rather inconvenient from my school and home - nor go grocery shopping, many of which are in malls. Nevermind that I can't buy takeout from certain food outlets in malls, guess I'll cook more often, but wait, I can't go grocery shopping. You're gonna tell me that I can go to standalone outlets, but as aforementioned, there are none near my school or home. I would have to go out of my way to carry out these basic activities and increase travel time and exposure. I see comments like: ""I can't go grocery shopping! Well then get vaxxed you idiot"" Do we not remember that it takes over a month for the entire regime? And at this point in time where the government boasts about over 85% vaccination rate, and the measures never being this extreme in the past yet is such during a time when they say we are making progress, is it really necessary at this very moment?

As Sinopharm was not part of the national programme, it was a lot more inconvenient to get it, but inconvenience aside, it was nearly impossible to during the initial stages because of the overwhelming demand. I am just a student that still has to go to school almost everyday, buy lunch or dinner back occasionally for my family, and go grocery shopping on my way home sometimes. Our way of life is thoroughly disrupted and made nearly impossible to carry out because of the new restrictions. And this all boils down to the fact that our preference was Sinopharm, which causes us to be fully vaxxed later than others. Is it wrong that we had a different preference? If you think it's a sin, then you do you.","Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13 Likely a very unpopular opinion but because I'm part of a so-called minority, just thought I wanted to share a different perspective amidst all the scolding of ""anti-vax idiots"".

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","To be honest, this rule is a way for them to slow down the spread of severe Covid Cases. It also helps protect those that that are unvaccinated.

I don't think people should be interpreting it as a rule that disadvantages certain people only (ie. discrimination). Treat it as something for your own well being. It's to protect yourself. Even the vaccinated can't be out for long since we can get infected too (or become a close contact). Once we get infected, we'll be stuck at home for a good 10 days - and the probability of getting infected going out right now is pretty high too.

We're all struggling together to be honest. The difference is that the virus really loves picking on weak immunities.

I doubt it will be a permanent rule anyway. Once the virus peaks, it should start to go down as herd immunity kicks in. Hopefully. Delta makes achieving it a lot more complicated though.

All in all, have patience. We won't be stuck at home forever - including the unvaccinated. Stay focused on keeping yourself safe unvaccinated people.

Actually I prefer this current phase, let them be comfortable and then boom everyone starts travelling freely and posts on their ig and fb. Then you will start seeing their dead inside faces, their kids will start to ask them and tell them stories about their friends going to so and so countries. Media personalities will start travelling and share their tips and places travelled.

Sounds like fun and they will start to really wonder what the heck they fighting for. Purchase more ivermectin, bitch about the gov more and be just stuck at home with shitloads of ivermectin. While their children may or may not stick with them in the silly meaningless fight over nothing. 

Tears, so much tears when some of them start to get vaccinated, they get betrayed, they stick their heels in the sand and wait for more ivermectin. Tough it out for another year or 2 before the rest of the world truely moves on from covid, they will still be under danger of ending up in ICU. Up dosage of ivermectin at this stage. 

Honestly it's a sad long and looney fight against the vaccine. Not to mention downright dangerous, risking themselves and their family. Someone will eventually break and just take the vaccine, it will break families, and cause more rift and causing some to be pushed to the brink of never ever getting the vaccine, since 'it has gotten to the family'. They will need to stuck it out and believe that their choices are right, just no one is smart enough to see it. 

Just you wait for the decade or a couple of decades to pass and some dumb ass luck of not catching covid. The price of getting the vaccine like sheep will show itself.  What exactly no one knows. Then... When the day comes, they WILL have the last laugh. The rest of the world have moved on with their lives and covid is no longer an issue, but a lone group of hardcore's decides to not be vaccinated and reject any vaccinated blood transfusion.

https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/nearly-60-of-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-in-israel-fully-vaccinated-study-finds.html

‚ÄúData from COVID-19 tests in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore are showing that vaccinated people who become infected with Delta SARS-CoV-2 can carry as much virus in their nose as do unvaccinated people. This means that despite the protection offered by vaccines, a proportion of vaccinated people can pass on Delta, possibly aiding its rise.‚Äù

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02187-1

‚ÄúThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday released three studies on the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. A UK study released Tuesday showed people with ""breakthrough"" infections carry as much virus as the unvaccinated.‚Äù

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-vaccine-protection-less-effective-against-delta-variant/

‚ÄúThe short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.‚Äù

""Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar viral loads in communities with a high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant""

‚ÄúWe find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsrael: Nearly 60% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel fully vaccinated, data shows‚Äù

https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/nearly-60-of-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-in-israel-fully-vaccinated-study-finds.html

‚ÄúData from COVID-19 tests in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore are showing that vaccinated people who become infected with Delta SARS-CoV-2 can carry as much virus in their nose as do unvaccinated people. This means that despite the protection offered by vaccines, a proportion of vaccinated people can pass on Delta, possibly aiding its rise.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday released three studies on the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. A UK study released Tuesday showed people with ""breakthrough"" infections carry as much virus as the unvaccinated.‚Äù

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-vaccine-protection-less-effective-against-delta-variant/

‚ÄúThe short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.‚Äù

""Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar viral loads in communities with a high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant""

‚ÄúWe find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.‚Äù

At this point everyone is entrenched in their own opinions - further arguments are unlikely to move the needle. 

Sure, yes, balance as between the rights of the collective and the rights of the individual is fine. I think this much everyone can agree. The issue is how to find that balance, especially in this uncertain circumstance. 

We have to take a step back and look at the situation - I think the main issue the government is trying to avoid is to max out our hospital capacity.

At this point everyone is entrenched in their own opinions - further arguments are unlikely to move the needle. 

Sure, yes, balance as between the rights of the collective and the rights of the individual is fine. I think this much everyone can agree. The issue is how to find that balance, especially in this uncertain circumstance. 

We have to take a step back and look at the situation - I think the main issue the government is trying to avoid is to max out our hospital capacity.

"Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to dine in, enter malls, from Oct 13","No point arguing man just wanted to hear more about why people choose to not vaccinate. I agree that lack of long term data on mRNA vaccines is worrying as most vaccines undergo years of testing before roll out. I initially chose to remain unvaccinated with mRNA due to the same exact reason but my workplace peer pressured everyone to do it so.... I did it haha 

A few months ago where the covid cases and thus chance of getting covid was low, if one were to remain unvaccinated temporarily and wait for the sinopharm vaccine because it is a more familiar vaccine, I'll say that's an acceptable risk to take. 

But now with the cases being so high, it seems to me that the risk of getting covid and dying from it due to lack of vaccination (according to data from other countries) severely outweighs the benefits of waiting for the sinopharm/risk of mRNA vaccines. 

There is a good chance you (touch wood) might get covid and potentially die from it (touch wood again) and the data overwhelming suggests that vaccinated people don't die as much. So do you think perhaps it might be safer to just get the mRNA vaccine ASAP because the risk benefit considerations have changed over the past few weeks.

Latest literature shows massive reduction in protection after being fully vaccinated:

‚ÄúSix months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.‚Äù

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114583?query=featured_home


‚ÄúThe researchers said effectiveness declined gradually, starting from the first month after the second dose, accelerated after the fourth month and reached a low level of approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose.‚Äù

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-vaccine-immunity-fda-kids-5-to-11/

‚ÄúThe short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.‚Äù

Latest literature shows massive reduction in protection after being fully vaccinated:

‚ÄúSix months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.‚Äù

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114583?query=featured_home


‚ÄúThe researchers said effectiveness declined gradually, starting from the first month after the second dose, accelerated after the fourth month and reached a low level of approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated.

‚ÄúThe short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown. A nationwide vaccination campaign was initiated early in Israel, allowing for a real-world evaluation of the interaction between protection and time-from-vaccine. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021, as Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases. Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection. We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later. This preliminary finding should prompt further investigagions into long-term protection against different strains, and prospective clinical trials to examine the effect of a booster vaccine against breakthrough infection.‚Äù

It‚Äôs really disgusting that instead of engaging in a discussion you are behaving like a troll/shill demonizing anyone and anything that you don‚Äôt like. 

Here‚Äôs my reply in case you missed it: 

The 85% number of this article is derived by conjecture. Unfortunately it‚Äôs just wishful thinking. 

Latest literature shows massive reduction in protection after being fully vaccinated:

‚ÄúSix months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.‚Äù

Most of what you experienced sounds more like ignorance and bullying rather than ill-willed racism. Take me as an example, I did not know that there are Indians who put coconut oil in their hair. When I walk past an Indian who smells strongly in a scent that I am not usually accustomed to, I would always be thinking ""oh it's that Indian smell"". But that is because, to me, that is the best way to categorize that unusual pungent smell. 

Exert some confidence and voice out your concerns with your friends. Try to educate them. Use this as a litmus test to find out what friendship is worth maintaining. Life is too short to mould yourself into something you are not. And honestly, what do you have to lose? You can also try finding people through interest groups who would accept you for who you really are.

There will always be narrow-minded people who refuse to accept the cultures of other races, and frankly, those people are stupid. So if the only people who exhibit racist behaviors are either ignorant or stupid, why are you letting yourself get affected? Would you be angry at a dog for barking at you?

I am stereotyping here, but I would say that people who are dumb but thinks they are smart, are the worst offenders of racism. Their self-righteousness fuels their believes like nothing you have ever seen. However, those that know they aren't the brightest have always been extremely caring and accepting. This is not meant as a blanket statement, but I definitely believe that the odds are significantly higher.

One last thing, you will always be profiled by others based on your attributes, and that is a fact of life. You will never be able to change that. The only thing you can change is the surroundings you put yourself in, and how must of that ""profiling"" you let affect you. 

p.s. one more thing. Don't keep all these thoughts within you. Talk to your family and friends. All you have experienced so far is the most immature and dumbest part of your entire life. Understand yourself, know what you want, and fuck other's opinions. Good luck.

p.p.s an extra note: everyone has that phase of trying to fit in, thats normal. But that doesnt mean that you should/need to fit in. Others opinions probably seem like a huge deal when you are 16, but its honestly laughable when you grow up. Nothing should matter more to you than yourself (maybe other than family etc...). Live your life the way YOU want. Surround yourself with people who genuinely like you for who you are. Singapore has a problem with racism. That does not mean that you should willingly be subjected to racist behaviors. Confront those racist behaviours that make you uncomfortable.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Sorry to hear about your experience OP. Some thoughts and reflections as an Sg chinese:

1. Chinese privilege in Singapore is a very real thing. We need to be more aware and call it out whenever we see it. Actually, we first need to admit it exists. 

2. Racism is not binary yes/no. If it is, everyone you speak with will not be a racist , but yet minorities are on the receiving end of microaggressions and overt racism so often. I think it's more important to question our prejudices and stereotypes that lead to certain behavior.

3. When kids behave like shit, it's largely due to their parents. My parents said some pretty racist things behind closed doors back when I was a kid... Agree with other posters that bullying affect all kids but that's conflating different issues together.

4. I've lived as a minority overseas in both English and non-English countries, and experienced overt racism (e.g., heckling on the streets, name calling), microaggressions (e.g., asking me if I use chopsticks to eat pizza, telling me my English is good for a foreigner) and from young kids (e.g., calling me Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan)... This has made me painfully aware of how the minorities in SG are treated, often thru ""innocent"" or ""non-racist"" jokes or comments. You don't have to be ""racist"" to make someone else feel uncomfortable about their ethnicity or race. 

To the OP, I hope things get better for you and you get to be the best version of yourself in the future.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Hi OP,

I feel like racism is solely hate/prejudice based on skin colour.

For your first point where teachers makes jokes in Chinese, I agree that it can be uncomfortable but if we forbid speaking our mother tongue in group settings wouldn't it be very suffocating? I feel like many minorities speak their mother tongue when with their friends as well.

Second point is racism. Fair and fair.

Third point, people tend to perceive things they are unfamiliar with prejudice. But it can happen for a kpop dance or any sort of dance for that matter. A pole dance would also probably get jeered by primary school kids. So it's unpleasant but I don't feel like it's racism.

Once again, unfamiliar. If I brought smelly tofu to the canteen I would get laughed at by my friends as well... Alot of things u mentioned here are things you do actively. It can be suffocating for others if a Chinese goes to class wearing a strong different smelling perfume. And honestly, shaving is really a personal opinion thing. Some people do, some people don't. There are Chinese that can be quite hairy as well and it could well be pointed out by others just like you did. 

I'm using Chinese as an example as they are the majority in Singapore. Of course this is my personal opinion, please do share with me if I'm flawed in my understanding somewhat.","I‚Äôm so sick of it Hi OP,

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Hey I'm so sorry that you experienced what you have.

But I do hope that you can find hope in patience. People's  stereotypes and beliefs don't change overnight, but they do change as each generation grows up.

Our parents' generation grew up without having a common language with other races. They grew up in a period where communities look inwards for help and where that was the only concept of community. Singapore as a nation was in its infancy and even today, we are still trying to figure out what Singaporean really mean. What this probably mean was that anyone outside their familiar concept of community was alien and thus, there was little need to understand them and thus results in racism. Racism stemming from ignorance and not malicious intent, but still racism. 

But one thing I am sure, is that majority of the younger generations do not believe in all those ridiculous racial stereotypes once they reach an age where they can reason. I used to hear stereotypes about the minority races too, from relatives etc. But I don't think any of them are right. What is more important is that I won't pass them on to my kids, and I will educate my kids that these stereotypes are wrong. I hope to believe that there is a silent majority like me out there who will effect this inter generational change.

I hope you can find hope in that things will change for the better. A decade or two ago, it would have been quite impossible for such casual racism or overt racism to be called out. I think it was largely because back then, there was an even lower degree of understanding of what racism really is. We are now aware that what was previously accepted (perhaps due to circumstances of the times when there were other more pressing concerns or simply greater ignorance in society) should not be accepted anymore now that we have grown as a society. The natural next step will be change for the better. I can't see our society ignoring these issues forever when we are already demonising racist individuals online. 

I can't say the same for everyone, but if my kid ever do anything racist, I can assure you that I will be the first to call it out, make sure that my kid learns what is wrong about it and make sure it does not happen again.","I‚Äôm so sick of it Hey I'm so sorry that you experienced what you have.

Growing up Chinese Singaporean, it‚Äôs probably not surprise that I learnt overwhelmingly racist behaviours from my family. All of primary and secondary school I was a part of this phenomenon of ‚Äúmicro aggression‚Äù. 

I started to question my behaviour in my late teens but it wasn‚Äôt until I left Singapore that I was on the receiving end of racism daily. 

Lived in 3 different countries in Europe since then and I genuinely feel like life as an Asian minority is easier in most of north-western Europe than life is as a South Asian in Singapore.

Similar themes all over the world is that the local majority will: downplay your struggles, celebrate your efforts at being less culturally authentic and make racist jokes with you because they see you as ‚Äúone of them‚Äù.  

What makes life easier for me though, is that in most of the major cities in north-western Europe, people are too worried about being perceived as racist. Openly racist statements and policies aren‚Äôt commonplace. 

OP didn‚Äôt mention this and probably hasn‚Äôt started working yet but in Singapore there are job ads that say ‚ÄúChinese speaking only‚Äù despite English being the spoken language in most places, rental ads saying ‚ÄúNo Indians‚Äù. As a result, if I stay within the right circles (gentrified neighbourhoods and I work in tech), I can easily go through life without being too bothered by the subtle racism. 

Living life as a minority as been a teaching and humbling experience and has made it difficult for me to go back to being ‚Äúone of them‚Äù back home in Singapore.

Going back to Singapore for me always meant dealing with racist comments from my family. I recall one particularly tense situation last year where I discussed having difficulties with my new manager due to differences in work culture. My words were ‚ÄúI think we value different things at work and I‚Äôm really need to understand his working style because otherwise it won‚Äôt work out‚Äù. My father replied with ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry we also don‚Äôt like Indians. You don‚Äôt have to worry about justifying yourself‚Äù. I did not respond well to that at all and the rest of the dinner did not go well. 

I cannot change the way I was raised and how my family is but I will do everything in my power to make sure that I do not pass this onto the next generation. All I have been doing so far is to make sure to stop such conversations where I can. It‚Äôs unfortunately human nature to discriminate and I don‚Äôt think that things will change in my lifetime. 

I am sorry that people like the OP have to grow up in a society that forced them to repressed themselves to fit in. It is my hope that more  Singaporeans become aware that we are not ‚Äúregardless of race, language or religion‚Äù.

As a Chinese who immigrated to Australia at the young age, whenever I'm back in Singapore, I frequently have friends and family asking me, ""aren't people racist there?"" and in my mind, I'm cringing and thinking, yeah, some are, but there's a whole bloody lot of racists here too. I don't understand the disconnect where you're afraid of being a minority and being ridiculed and discriminated against, yet treat others the exact way you don't wanna be treated!!? It's insane!

Having heard remarks from my own family about Indians and darker skinned races, I am always doing my best to educate them and speak out about their discriminatory words and actions and I hope other people are doing the same too! It's devastating that there are Singaporeans who are dealing with this shit in this day and age.. Stay strong OP, I hope you'll sincerely embrace your wonderful culture and be proud of it!! Indians are so lovely and kind, your culture is beautiful and you guys food is bomb af! Racists will always be around but know that there are many people who are rooting for you and all the minorities everywhere. Take care :)",1505
I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Can't say I ever been to Singapore but I can relate, born in America, son of Indian immigrants, I forced myself to assimilate so I wouldn't get bullied, but it never really worked. As I got older, things got better, but I attribute that to the fact that I got better at blending in. 

I will never forget what one of my classmates said in highschool about another Indian who wasn't as adept at ""fitting in"", he said, ""Man, why can't Raj be like you? People would make fun of him less if he just tried to be normal. You're normal, sometimes I forget that you're Indian.""

I was normal because I repressed my identity, I stopped associating with Indians, I stopped eating Indian food, I refused to learn my parents language, didn't let my parents meet any of my ""friends"" and was constantly embarrassed. All out of shame for what I was.

Let me be crystal clear, the US is not a racist country, in fact, out of any of the countries I've been in, it's been the most accommodating, and I hate the fact that other countries like Canada or the European ones take this moral high ground. You are full of shit, you may like to pretend you are superior, but you're not, and I'd hazard to say that you're worse. At least America attempts heterogeneity, no other white dominant country is even close the ethnic mixing that America has managed to achieve

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Thank you and hugs, OP. You have all right to be sick of it. It's upsetting to see how racism is still very much prevalent here, and how hurtful it can be to people. I hate how all of it is so irrational and ridiculous. And the double standards. The gall one must have to claim that curry is 'smelly' or will 'stink up my house' while durians apparently are 'an acquired taste'. What the fuck.

I've been contemplating on whether to comment or not, but I figured I should give my experiences. I'm half Italian, half Chinese. It is incredibly privileged of me to say this from my end (for instance my own school experience was pretty uneventful in terms of race) but I hate how I've seen how racism and stereotyping manifest (not only negatively but also to a positive end) and has even favoured me over others purely by my own race. I've been given opportunities on basis of being 'ang moh', and somehow meaning I automatically had better English because of my race alone rather than actual ability. Admittedly this was probably in part also due to my accent (being international schooled does that to you) but even before I spoke there was this favouring already in place. Meanwhile, fellow Malays didn't even get a chance. Even in spite of this 'pedestal', people would still mock my accent excessively, even when I told them to stop it. Pasta jokes or doing the 'Italian hand gesture' gets real stale after the 50th time.

I know my experiences don't compare. Even in my NS, I was incredibly fortunate to mostly be around very understanding and friendly people. I can't say I've been actively looked at with disgust or hatred. In the end, I can just simply give a sarcastic quip in return and treat them more like an overly running gag. But experiences and remarks like what you've gone through can cut deep and impact for many long years. This is our home, after all and racism should have no place in it.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Hey OP! I'm sorry you had to go through all that and I do hope you are feeling better. I raised this question to another redditor but perhaps it could be something we can discuss too. It may not be that relevant to what you've posted but it's something that has been confusing me due to recent events.

I'll speak candidly about a recent incident. A parody of the gong lady incident was made by an ""influencer"" which was deemed offensive and then taken down. I am one of those who did not watch it, so it leaves me speculating as to what was actually in the video.

In an ideal world, probably no one would have made such a video that would be construed as offensive. As a majority who wants to learn more about sensitivity and empathy, would it be more prudent to leave the video up as an example of what not to do? Of course when it is in the domain of inciting hate and violence it should be taken down, but in instances where it might not be the case, where do we draw the lines to determine if we were to let an offensive material be available?

A main talking point is how we should not shy away from the reality that there is racism, and that we should acknowledge the existence of it and not sweep it under the rug anymore. But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.

So my honest question to a minority would be whether ""cancelling"" an offensive piece of work end up actually causing more harm than intended? Would it be tantamount to not acknowledging the scourge of racism? I'm a majority who sincerely wants to learn more, and because that video has been removed, all I know is that it was racist and not why it was racist. It leaves me to feel that I should not engage a minority for the fear of unintentionally being offensive.

I'm not sure if that is how I want it to be. Should Hanlon's razor be used to never attribute to malice which is adequately explained by stupidity?","I‚Äôm so sick of it Hey OP!

Then comes the usual comments about skin colour, people ignoring you in shops, even my colleagues telling me I would never get anywhere in the company as the management didn‚Äôt like Indians (this was the furthest thing from the truth actually). You learn to live with it, nothing you can do.

The only thing that sort of solved this issue was money and status. I did well at my company, the Chinese Singaporean management was amazing and didn‚Äôt see race at all. But I‚Äôll be honest most companies aren‚Äôt like this, while they aren‚Äôt overtly racist, they‚Äôre unlikely to promote a Malay or Indian to management level.

With the increase in money and status, racism seemed to fade away. Nobody asked me about race when I wanted to rent a whole condo and the landed place I live in now. I thought racism was coming down in Singapore but that wasn‚Äôt it. Status trumps race in Singapore.

Bottom line is, make that dough. Success is the only way to move beyond the lower echelons and get people to treat you with respect. Walk into an expensive shop as an Indian and you may get some funny looks but flash an expensive watch or credit card and see the difference.

This is definitely not the answer you wanted to hear but for now it‚Äôs the reality.

Childrens' minds are very moldable, and the ideals we set in them could very well stay with them for a lifetime.

With the digital age, it has kinda become a ""kampung"" of sorts; everyone is free to speak their mind and everyone can freely share themselves. This has helped us flesh out the problems and grievances we have, without fear of retaliation. But many of our older generation don't really know how to access this digital ""kampung"".

Although OP is venting out to many people, it is nothing but a small pocket of Singapore. I feel that in order to really bring out social change, we must be willing to host open meetings (in CCs) with members of differing races and religions, where people are not afraid to share their opinions, regardless of whether they are racist or not.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Most people don't mean to be racist. They just lack the sensitivity due to insufficient exposure. Depending on each individual's personality, one would act differently.

There might be people who know that racial topics are sensitive and will stay away from it. Even to the extent of distancing themselves for fearing of making mistakes. So this might get mistaken as a form of segregation by the minorities.

There might be another group of people who are more outspoken and might accidentally make remarks that are inappropriate unknowingly. 

And of course, there is always a group of people who just can't get along with anyone different from them and refuse to tolerate little differences.

They just lack the sensitivity due to insufficient exposure. Depending on each individual's personality, one would act differently.

There might be people who know that racial topics are sensitive and will stay away from it. Even to the extent of distancing themselves for fearing of making mistakes. So this might get mistaken as a form of segregation by the minorities.

There might be another group of people who are more outspoken and might accidentally make remarks that are inappropriate unknowingly. 

And of course, there is always a group of people who just can't get along with anyone different from them and refuse to tolerate little differences.

1) Speak with your family, hopefully a parent or sibling. They face it at work and definitely have stories to tell. These stories can help you feel less alone.

2) Seek out resources that can educate you about institutional racism, internalized racism, and race in Singapore, hopefully in some non-profit or university.

edit: nvm briefly read your other comments you‚Äôre just straight up either racist/insensitive. i hope you have a pleasant life, i‚Äôll never wish ill on someone else even if i don‚Äôt agree with their beliefs.",1183

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Sadly, it feels as if the older I get the more intolerance I see. I think it has to do with social media and all, and how people think it is perfectly ok to be overtly racist... Be sure that's what their echo chamber is saying. So they are reinforced.

When I was much younger, I had neighbours of all races and religion and we all celebrated pretty much everything together and accepted the practices of each racial or religious group. That's probably atypical and not representative of the entire Singapore but nowadays you get people who feel very emboldened to make insulting remarks about religious practices belonging to religions they do not subscribe to and feel very proud and justified in their behaviour.

While I do not believe such discrimination can disappear overnight, we need to do better and I feel one tiny simple step that costs nothing from us, is simply to erase all race markers from our speech.

e.g. ""See that Chinese guy over there?""

I don't need you to identify his race for me. You can probably point him out with his clothes or something. 

We need to work hard on not pinning a race on everyone we see, the first thing we see them.

This does not solve current problems though but hopefully someday our society can progress to greater racial harmony.","I‚Äôm so sick of it Sadly, it feels as if the older I get the more intolerance I see.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Hey! Thanks for the insightful comment. I too feel confused from recent events when it comes to drawing lines.

I'll speak candidly about a recent incident. A parody of the gong lady incident was made by an ""influencer"" which was deemed offensive and then taken down. I am one of those who did not watch it, so it leaves me speculating as to what was actually in the video.

In an ideal world, probably no one would have made such a video that would be construed as offensive. As a majority who wants to learn more about sensitivity and empathy, would it be more prudent to leave the video up as an example of what not to do? Of course when it is in the domain of inciting hate and violence it should be taken down, but in instances where it might not be the case, where do we draw the lines to determine if we were to let an offensive material be available?

A main talking point is how we should not shy away from the reality that there is racism, and that we should acknowledge the existence of it and not sweep it under the rug anymore. But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.

So my honest question to a minority would be whether ""cancelling"" an offensive piece of work end up actually causing more harm than intended? Would it be tantamount to not acknowledging the scourge of racism? I'm a majority who sincerely wants to learn more, and because that video has been removed, all I know is that it was racist and not why it was racist. It leaves me to feel that I should not engage a minority for the fear of unintentionally being offensive.

I'm not sure if that is how I want it to be. Should Hanlon's razor be used to never attribute to malice which is adequately explained by stupidity?","I‚Äôm so sick of it Hey! Thanks for the insightful comment. I too feel confused from recent events when it comes to drawing lines.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Racist is a term used to describe prejudice against a certain race. What the ""young racists"" are doing is merely prejudice because someone is different. It happens everywhere, if someone is oddly short/tall, fat/skinny. Kids make fun of them. This is obviously not right and we should correct it as we grow older just like with skin colour. But the kids aren't being racist as they don't have the knowledge yet to understand cultural/religious differences.

I don't think racism is exactly about thinking other races practices are disgusting.

For eg, I'm sure that alot of people dislike Chinese eating dogs. I too dislike it. But am I racist against Chinese? It is the fact that my personal opinion and values do not agree with this behaviour. (sorry couldn't think of a better example). I do feel like there are many indian/Malay practices that many people don't find disgusting for eg. fasting for malays Muslims. Their religious practices do not directly affect the rest. 

But when religious practice affect other people we have to accommodate and understand to a certain extent. Like Chinese funerals making alot of noise.

I agree that there are some risks and that the rewards may outweigh the risks.

If it's content that outright promotes hate and violence it should be taken down.

It's a bit hard to put in words, but because I only saw outrage at the content and the result which was having it taken down and the creator take a hiatus, I would need to err on the side of caution if it was a initial interaction with a minority.

I am genuinely quite sad about it, just like how I feel when I read your account. Perhaps it was because how I have been easily interacting with minorities since young, joining football teams in Primary, Secondary, Pre-University and socially which was dominated by minorities (there's a tinge of sadness I have to differentiate here), the roommate of mine in University from a minority race (again I feel sad to have to make a distinction), travelling overseas with friends from other races and attending each others' weddings and festivities that make me feel this way. 

I now see the privilege I have in that it was not difficult for me to have close minority friends throughout my life. When I think about the current climate applied to the past, would I have these friends in my life? 

But I do have these friends and experiences and I am thankful for that. Do I feel that the advocacy and activism might have been a little too much to make me now feel like maybe it would not be a possibility today? Perhaps.

If even I were to have all these feelings, the ones you talked about would have been greater. I'm sorry OP and I hope things get better for you. Thank you for talking :)","I‚Äôm so sick of it Thank you for replying! :)

But an example is the teachers. With the teachers I always felt that the chinese were more stuck up while the indians were more humble. The student seemed to be nicer (sucked up) to the chinese. 

This might be a culture difference however since in Denmark university teachers are shown respect but we also talk to them as friends. 

It was also maybe just an off feeling i got from walking around and looking at different people.

OP, and so many other minority voices, are trying to educate you of the kind of shit we go through on a daily basis, and the actions we have to take just to have a normal Singaporean life, at the expense of our cultural identity.

do you think typing on ur keyboard acting smug and saying that this is a part of society is going to help anyone? is it really more important for you to act strong for being not PC and not sensitive and having such thick skin that you can brush off bullying? 

realise that the shit we have to go through from **people like you** every day is something you will never experience in Singapore. please try and stop trying to win the oppression game, and listen to those who are actually living under a system of oppression - a system you, as an ethnic majority, are benefiting from.","I‚Äôm so sick of it how are you empathising? you are insinuating that you are somehow stronger than OP because you were able to just brush off your bullies and she should just be more thick skinned. you're casually ignoring the fact that you can do this and still live a normal life because of the fact that you dont have the hurdle of being a minority to get over.

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Your first point is exactly why it isn't racism. It's the same being made fun of because someone is different instead of solely due to race.

It is hard to separate race, religion and culture as they are most often interlinked. Less say nowadays but that's beside the point.

Fact: Indian food is typically made with alot of spices. I won't say they smell bad personally.

But they have strong smells, which is why it might attract attention.

Fact: different people have different sense of smell. Some people are okay with blue cheese/kimchi, some are not.

Is it racist for someone to point out OP food is smelly? No because it is a personal opinion. Just like how I feel that durian is smelly but some people don't.

Sorry I couldn't think of a better example for the Chinese eating dogs but the point is that it is targeted towards certain behaviour instead of race. People will get uncomfortable when ur behavior triggers certain response irregardless or your race. 

Of course we know there are 4 different races in P1. But the process of maturing and understanding differences is something that can last throughout a lifetime. The kid might be at fault but to what extent does he understand and know what his words/actions might have.

I'm not saying there is no racism in singapore. But I hope that op can zoom out and see the examples he provided irregardless of race. If he/she were Chinese and doused his head in coconut oil everyday, I guarantee he/she will still be made fun of by the same group of people.

Sometimes not everything is about race.","I‚Äôm so sick of it Your first point is exactly why it isn't racism. It's the same being made fun of because someone is different instead of solely due to race.

Just some additional comments for potentially more downvotes...

As a Chinese, I have to be completely honest about the stereotype people had on my race and culture. While it may be painful to hear, I can completely understand where they are coming from, and I don't see the need to go all out and bash an entire group of people for their ignorance. What I can do is to change other's perception about \[us\] one at a time and hopefully the representative giants make progress.

I get downvoted for voicing out what's consider unpopular. The Chinese in Singapore has had their fair share of misunderstanding, judgement and discrimination. The Chinese has come a long way and has ditched lots of their old habits and practices to gain acceptance by the world. Have you seen any Singaporean Chinese going around playing victim card saying that the west has made the Chinese lose their cultural identity (Boohoo, brushing teeth daily is so Un-Chinese)? No. Instead it is seen as a progress for the entire population.

Not that I am saying other race or ethnic group should do the same. But, I hope that people can wake up and accept that certain difference among various racial group do exist. When people had some reaction to those differences, let's first assume non-malicious and, if you wish, try to make them understand you.

Nitpicking things that happen several decades ago and use it as a weapon against an entire race group doesn't make you any less racist than those who you complaint about in the story.

The Redditors can downvote me to hell but I will still say; if we continue to promote and encourage such bigotry behaviour, we will not be too far from having a second racial war in Singapore.

That's all I had to say...

That's very lively imagination of you, but all wrong. So all of the rest is also wrong. 

""White privilege""? LOL. I've always been a minority and a non-white minority in places I've live in (outside my country of birth)

I‚Äôm so sick of it,"Well then perhaps you should stop being so, for lack of a better word, ""racist"", in trying to fit people into neat boxes to explain their actions and instead accept that humans are inherently diverse in their motivation and actions. Likewise, talks of ""non-physical violent words"" by an ethnic majority that can harm a minority is kinda stupid.

If anything, Singapore is simply going through the same convulsions that a Frankenstein state born from the colonialism days goes through in the last 70 years to resolve the ethnic tensions. In most places flooded with guns, the state breaks into small chunks in climatic show downs. Singaporeans have no guns, and people are forced to be mixed. In others, by the democratic traditions that stretches back hundreds of years, people understand that being the majority that wins 51% of the votes doesn't mean you get all the power. True authority in democracies means ""the majority rules with the consent of the minority"". In Singapore's case, the majority thinks they have the rights to rule, consent be damned; but the minority couldn't coalesce into GRCs that can sway votes.
