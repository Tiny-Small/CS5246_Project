Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Jordan, etc. allow US troops and bases on their soil as a hedge against Iran and its proxies. Bahrain is homport to the US Navy's 5th. Fleet which conducts regular military operations in the Persian Gulf region. The Bahrain government is aware of it. Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base hosts the US Air Force which conducts regular military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc. The Qatar government is aware of it. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is the world's second biggest importer of US weapons and they've used these tech toys against fellow Arab \"brother\" Yemen. In late 2018 Saudi Arabia inked a US$42 billion deal with China which includes a factory that manufactures Chinese made hunter killer drones. Welcome to the club, China. These drones won't be used to provide food and medicine but to hunt and kill in the cauldron of the Mid-East. And Syrian president Assad has invited the Russians into Syria to quell internal rebellion and to help him maintain his grip on power. While Japan and South Korea maintain tens of thousands of US troops and bases on their soil as a hedge against North Korea and China. Germany also maintain thousands of US troops on its soil as a hedge against Russia. All of the above, the US and Russia would oblige if it suits their national interests. Basically, there are no innocent angelic countries.",

        "Comment": "George Lee i definitely agree that most successful businesses pay their workers well, but unfortunately not enough SMEs which most F&Bs fall under do that. You may also be confused about the issue, most F&B manpower are Work Permit holders, as opposed to S-Pass and Employment Pass holders that just had their minimum salary criteria adjusted upwards. S-Pass holders in F&B are those in supervisory roles, which can be done by Singaporeans. That said, it's heartening that since the pandemic, more local businesses have pledged to have a citizens-first hiring policy as opposed to taking advantage of cheaper foreign labour like before. A business should thrive on innovation and capabilities, certainly not rely on cheap labour as the mainstay for profitability. If businesses are feeling the manpower crunch, be it for WP, S-Pass or EP, then they should approach the gov through their associations to work out a better form of control in hiring foreigners, a tighter headcount criteria by industry or specific field, rather than further raising the minimum salary bar.",

Its all our locals because foreigners are not able to apply for these jobs. These jobs are by no means easy. Its physical, it can be dangerous, its sweaty work, come rain and shine, as per our weather. I'm sure there can be a balance. If fnb and retail shops are willing to hire locals, don't find excuses. If delivery companies can attract so many local staff, why can't you? Instead of being stuck in your comfort zone hiring foreigners at a suppressed salary, and like 12 cupcakes has shown, they are willing to accept salaries even lower than the company published, because that's still more than they can make back home. Offer these salaries to student part timers, provide work flexibility to accomodate their class schedules, and you'll see you don't have a lack of applicants, you won't have to drastically increase your prices and hence lose your customers, and you can do the right thing by supporting our local economy and our locals.
