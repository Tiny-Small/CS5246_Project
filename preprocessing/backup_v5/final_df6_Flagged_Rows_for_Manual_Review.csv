1) The answer is yes because we are shortchange of Education in Singapore.

2a) Almost everyone is the world who graduate from Secondary School are consider Year 10 Standard.

2b) Most jobs in overseas required their candidates to have at least Year 10 Standard for their education, however only GCE O graduate in Singapore are consider Year 10 Standard. GCE Normal (Academic) are consider Year 9 and Standard and GCE Normal (Technical) are consider Year 8 Standard.

3a) In Singapore, we cannot create a private university to confer degree. However other country allow it which end up job candidates buying real qualification like Bachelor Degree in their home country to look for jobs overseas.

3b) In Singapore, majorly of Singaporeans do not end up in public local university to get a Bachelor Degree because of stringent requirement. However in other countries, they have private vocational institutes offering qualifications like BTEC in UK and TAFE in Australia to help them get back to public local university.","In Singapore, majorly of Singaporeans do not end up in public local university to get a Bachelor Degree because of stringent requirement.",Singaporeans,do not end up in public local university,SADNESS,opinion_too_long

western media will not tell you that ukraine has been forcing luhansk and donetsk regions to be part of it, in spite of vast majority of the people choosing to be independent via a referendum. what they want you to believe is that vladimir putin is bullying innocent ukraine for pleasure.

western media will not tell you that trampling on ukraine's sovereignty is not moscow kremlin's main aim but survival against us-led nato's encroachment, with the insistence on admitting ukraine into nato after allowing other eastern european countries: bulgaria, estonia, latvia, lithuania, romania, slovakia, and slovenia to join.

america can recognise the independence of taiwan but russia cannot recognise the independence of luhansk and donetsk.

america can recognise jerusalem as the capital of israel but russia cannot take back its people in crimean peninsula after they voted to join them.

western media want you to believe that the west is always right while russia and china are the perpetual bad guys.

But given the 2014 annexation of Crimea it seems the Ukranians have put much more effort into preparation and funding than the Russians would have anticipated.,But given the 2014 annexation of Crimea it seems the Ukranians have put much more effort into preparation and funding than the Russians would have anticipated.,Ukranians,put much more effort into preparation and funding,JOY,opinion_too_long
880,"Thanks for giving an honest account. This debate seems to becoming too polarised and lacking in respect.To give another opinion though, you decided to choose a different path to what the government strongly recommended. Now the country is being held back because healthcare resources are being stretched by others who made a similar decision. I think it's perfectly fair that the government puts the needs of the country first, and you have to live with the consequences of your decision.","I think it's perfectly fair that the government puts the needs of the country first, and you have to live with the consequences of your decision.",government,puts the needs of the country first,JOY,opinion_too_long

It would have been better if they said something like ""Have gotten first dose by Oct 13th"" like what France did, because then at least you'll see an increase of people who think ""oh, shit!"" and will rush to get vaccinated. Now, those people will not be urged to be vaccinated because even if they do, they need to wait at least 4-5 weeks before they can enjoy the benefits.

911,"i'm really sorry that you had such a bad experience during your elective in singapore :( I wish such things didn't exist but sadly I know that they do, especially the part about being competitive to secure interesting cases/flocking to examine patients/disturbing them when they're resting or with their families. I've come across doctors who excuse or even encourage such behaviour too. What you described in your first post is rather shocking to me though, not that I'm doubting your account, but perhaps because I've not been in the wards for long enough to personally observe anybody being so rude and selfish! (Tbh, I somewhat wish you had told them off for their behaviour and refused to converse with the poor granny on their behalf lol. but I understand that you wouldn't have wanted any conflict either). I think there's a vast spectrum of personalities amongst students and I rly hope I don't come across as defensive, but just hoped to reassure you that the people that you were unfortunate enough to be grouped with during your elective aren't representative of local med students as a whole! personally, amongst the batchmates & seniors i've been grouped with so far, we share the same policy of always waiting for the patient to be awake even if we have to come back multiple times and find the patient asleep every single time. we also forgo our chance to examine patients with rare conditions if we realise that many of our batchmates/seniors have disturbed them already. That being said, I don't know what the majority of students are like, and I certainly wouldn't know about how it's like 'compared to doctors in Malaysia/UK' as I haven't had any electives yet (but for the few UK-trained doctors I've observed so far, i've always liked how they treat their patients). It makes me wonder though, whether pressure (from peers/tutors/deadlines/etc) eventually cause some students to abandon the priorities & principles that they originally had, or whether they were already selfish to begin with? If it's the latter, then maybe the admissions process is still very much flawed, but if it's the former, what went wrong along the way? :/ Perhaps a vicious cycle of ""monkey see monkey do"" also contributes to this. E.g. i suspect that some students think it's ok to wake sleeping patients up because they see doctors/nurses do it so often. But they forget that the context is different because they aren't contributing to the care of those patients, so they shouldn't be disturbing them. And it's worse when it comes to behaviour that is borderline unethical, but becomes acceptable just 'cause ""I saw Dr So-and-So do this before, so it must be fine for me to do the same.""     I sure hope that this won't happen to my friends and I despite the stress, but being human, i'm sure we will face the same temptation at some point. So thanks for your post - it's a good reminder for me to consciously watch what I do and always always put myself in the patients' shoes, before the stress tempts me to do differently :)Lastly, to everyone who comes across this comment - it's your right to say no to a medical student who wants to discuss your condition/examine you, please don't say yes just out of pressure! We wouldn't want to unknowingly cause you further distress - although we see many patients in the hospitals day in day out and it may thus be tempting to think of being hospitalised as a small issue, when we stop to think about it, it would be a significant event to each patient .

And it's worse when it comes to behaviour that is borderline unethical, but becomes acceptable just 'cause ""I saw Dr So-and-So do this before, so it must be fine for me to do the same.""     I sure hope that this won't happen to my friends and I despite the stress, but being human, i'm sure we will face the same temptation at some point. So thanks for your post - it's a good reminder for me to consciously watch what I do and always always put myself in the patients' shoes, before the stress tempts me to do differently :)Lastly, to everyone who comes across this comment - it's your right to say no to a medical student who wants to discuss your condition/examine you, please don't say yes just out of pressure! We wouldn't want to unknowingly cause you further distress - although we see many patients in the hospitals day in day out and it may thus be tempting to think of being hospitalised as a small issue, when we stop to think about it, it would be a significant event to each patient . Of course, saying no nicely would beat saying no fiercely, we're all humans... :P And of course if you are really alright with it, then we really appreciate it!! every learning opportunity helps us to be a better doctor in future :)   ","Of course, saying no nicely would beat saying no fiercely, we're all humans... :P",saying no nicely,would beat saying no fiercely,JOY,opinion_conflicts_with_emotion
929,"i'm really sorry that you had such a bad experience during your elective in singapore :( I wish such things didn't exist but sadly I know that they do, especially the part about being competitive to secure interesting cases/flocking to examine patients/disturbing them when they're resting or with their families. I've come across doctors who excuse or even encourage such behaviour too. What you described in your first post is rather shocking to me though, not that I'm doubting your account, but perhaps because I've not been in the wards for long enough to personally observe anybody being so rude and selfish! (Tbh, I somewhat wish you had told them off for their behaviour and refused to converse with the poor granny on their behalf lol. but I understand that you wouldn't have wanted any conflict either). I think there's a vast spectrum of personalities amongst students and I rly hope I don't come across as defensive, but just hoped to reassure you that the people that you were unfortunate enough to be grouped with during your elective aren't representative of local med students as a whole! personally, amongst the batchmates & seniors i've been grouped with so far, we share the same policy of always waiting for the patient to be awake even if we have to come back multiple times and find the patient asleep every single time. we also forgo our chance to examine patients with rare conditions if we realise that many of our batchmates/seniors have disturbed them already. That being said, I don't know what the majority of students are like, and I certainly wouldn't know about how it's like 'compared to doctors in Malaysia/UK' as I haven't had any electives yet (but for the few UK-trained doctors I've observed so far, i've always liked how they treat their patients). It makes me wonder though, whether pressure (from peers/tutors/deadlines/etc) eventually cause some students to abandon the priorities & principles that they originally had, or whether they were already selfish to begin with? If it's the latter, then maybe the admissions process is still very much flawed, but if it's the former, what went wrong along the way? :/ Perhaps a vicious cycle of ""monkey see monkey do"" also contributes to this. E.g. i suspect that some students think it's ok to wake sleeping patients up because they see doctors/nurses do it so often. But they forget that the context is different because they aren't contributing to the care of those patients, so they shouldn't be disturbing them.

Their issue is not being unable to pay locals a liveable wage. The issue is they have a constant supply of cheap foreign labour because many come here with a short term goal to make money here, and return to their home country. They can work weekends, long hours, scrimp and save, because they have no family to raise here, no housing loan to pay off, their expenses are significantly less and when they return home, their sgd savings are enough. Locals cannot work these jobs at these suppressed wages and insane hours because they have a life here. An expensive life and a life that must be balanced with other commitments to spouses, parents and children. Theres no future in these jobs. But, look at all the delivery riders. See our boys in NS. You really think Singaporeans can't do tough jobs? They can and will, if you can offer a good fit. Local students are an untapped pool.

983,"Reading your post, I am going to say that the biggest reason why we see racism is because of education at a younger age.Childrens' minds are very moldable, and the ideals we set in them could very well stay with them for a lifetime. The parents that teach racist ideals, were probably exposed to racism at a younger age, and is no part of their psyche. With the digital age, it has kinda become a ""kampung"" of sorts; everyone is free to speak their mind and everyone can freely share themselves. This has helped us flesh out the problems and grievances we have, without fear of retaliation. But many of our older generation don't really know how to access this digital ""kampung"".Although OP is venting out to many people, it is nothing but a small pocket of Singapore. I feel that in order to really bring out social change, we must be willing to host open meetings (in CCs) with members of differing races and religions, where people are not afraid to share their opinions, regardless of whether they are racist or not. This way, we are able to clear out racist and religionist doubts, and open up an actual discussion.","With the digital age, it has kinda become a 'kampung' of sorts; everyone is free to speak their mind and everyone can freely share themselves.",digital age,become a 'kampung',JOY,opinion_too_long

Singapore is a wonderful place. But from my (white) perspective of living there, the enforced idea of ‘racial harmony’ was deeply oppressive. It seemed to force everyone to stick on a smile, and to accuse anyone who suggested things were NOT harmonious of threatening that very harmony the person was saying didn’t exist. Harmony comes from being free to discuss problems, and from anti-racism being actively taught. You can’t just teach ‘we all get along here’ when for so many that is patently untrue. OP, you are under no obligation to fix this problem because you’re clearly already exhausted. But you could - if you wanted to - get this letter published more widely in the ST or in We The Citizens. And I think it’s shocking your school didn’t detect and put a stop to the racism you experienced. You’re a wonderful young woman with immense courage.

This could negatively impact the livelihoods of local workers who rely on stable wages to meet their living costs.5. **Erosion of National Identity**: Some may argue that rapid immigration could lead to a **dilution of Singapore’s national identity.** They may believe that too many new citizens, especially those who may not embrace local traditions, could alter the unique cultural fabric that makes Singapore what it is.even Chatgpt disagree...","If new citizens are unable to assimilate or respect local customs and norms, it may lead to social friction or a sense of alienation within communities.",new citizens,unable to assimilate or respect local customs,SADNESS,opinion_too_long

2. nato added members in 1998, poland etc thereafter established military bases and installed missiles.
3 ukraine wanted to join nato.

2067,"Thank you and hugs, OP. You have all right to be sick of it. It's upsetting to see how racism is still very much prevalent here, and how hurtful it can be to people. I hate how all of it is so irrational and ridiculous. And the double standards. The gall one must have to claim that curry is 'smelly' or will 'stink up my house' while durians apparently are 'an acquired taste'. What the fuck.I've been contemplating on whether to comment or not, but I figured I should give my experiences. I'm half Italian, half Chinese. It is incredibly privileged of me to say this from my end (for instance my own school experience was pretty uneventful in terms of race) but I hate how I've seen how racism and stereotyping manifest (not only negatively but also to a positive end) and has even favoured me over others purely by my own race. I've been given opportunities on basis of being 'ang moh', and somehow meaning I automatically had better English because of my race alone rather than actual ability. Admittedly this was probably in part also due to my accent (being international schooled does that to you) but even before I spoke there was this favouring already in place. Meanwhile, fellow Malays didn't even get a chance. Even in spite of this 'pedestal', people would still mock my accent excessively, even when I told them to stop it. Pasta jokes or doing the 'Italian hand gesture' gets real stale after the 50th time.I know my experiences don't compare. Even in my NS, I was incredibly fortunate to mostly be around very understanding and friendly people. I can't say I've been actively looked at with disgust or hatred. In the end, I can just simply give a sarcastic quip in return and treat them more like an overly running gag. But experiences and remarks like what you've gone through can cut deep and impact for many long years. This is our home, after all and racism should have no place in it.I'll close by saying that you are above these fools - so please don't let this consume you, OP - live as you are and be proud for who you are, you are under no compellation to conform to their ridiculous expectations.",You have all right to be sick of it.,you,have all right to be sick of it,NEUTRAL,opinion_too_long

It may not be that relevant to what you've posted but it's something that has been confusing me due to recent events.I'll speak candidly about a recent incident. A parody of the gong lady incident was made by an ""influencer"" which was deemed offensive and then taken down. I am one of those who did not watch it, so it leaves me speculating as to what was actually in the video.In an ideal world, probably no one would have made such a video that would be construed as offensive. As a majority who wants to learn more about sensitivity and empathy, would it be more prudent to leave the video up as an example of what not to do? Of course when it is in the domain of inciting hate and violence it should be taken down, but in instances where it might not be the case, where do we draw the lines to determine if we were to let an offensive material be available?A main talking point is how we should not shy away from the reality that there is racism, and that we should acknowledge the existence of it and not sweep it under the rug anymore. But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.So my honest question to a minority would be whether ""cancelling"" an offensive piece of work end up actually causing more harm than intended? Would it be tantamount to not acknowledging the scourge of racism? I'm a majority who sincerely wants to learn more, and because that video has been removed, all I know is that it was racist and not why it was racist. It leaves me to feel that I should not engage a minority for the fear of unintentionally being offensive.I'm not sure if that is how I want it to be.

Of the remaining 1.6% infirmity is 50/50 Vaccinated vs unvaxxed, thus the argument that only unvaxxed are a burden on the healthcare system is an exaggeration,though the case that unvaxxed are over represented and overly burdensome in ICU is valid. With a hypothetical 100%vax rate, 100% of icu visits and deaths will be vaxxed individuals (vs the 30% vaxxed deaths currently), the vax does not give immunity. Isolation of unvaxxed to their homes should skew the forward numbers more in the direction of vaxxed being the burden on the healthcare system and give a truer overview of the prophylaxis of mrna vaccines. Regarding deaths, I cannot find a summary of vaxxed vs unvaxxed deaths since vaccination started nor since herd vaxxed rate was achieved, this would be useful. On the daily reading of MoH stats 4/6 recent deaths were vaxxed 2 unvaxxed, age and comorbidity were factors. Seperately and for cinsideration of preventable deaths, Singapore has over 2200 smoking related deaths per year (thus 142 covid deaths and 4400 smoking deaths since covid emerged in Wuhan) yet cigarettes remain on sale and smoking legal.. The impact of reducing deaths through eliminating smoking would of course not be seen for decades but is worth considering as second hand smoke also contributes to lung health issues in society. Restrictions on sugar would also reduce death from diabetes. Diabetes kills nearly 4400per annum (thus 8800sonce covid broke out).

I’ve met many adults who know how to ‘behave’ themselves in public but when it comes to conversations in their private groups, they freely talk about things @shimmynywimminy mentioned like how they supposedly smell etc. And not much of a surprise here, but the kids of these people also end up making racist jokes publicly, as such humour has been normalised in the environment they grew up in. Inevitably, i feel this + the naivety of kids only make things worse for a kid with a minority race growing up in Singapore, as underlined with the many examples OP have shared about.Honestly, the only difference between a typical racist kid and a typical racist adult is the knowledge to keep their racism out of their public actions. At the end of the day, their inward perceptions of other races are still the same type of rotten.","Precisely.

2589,Hi! Yes I understand that the risk of covid is real seeing all the numbers and I acknowledge the importance of vaccination. I'm not sure if you've misunderstood that I am still unvaccinated at this point (?) because I actually did manage to get an appointment about a month ago and will be getting my second dose very soon. The purpose of my original comment was to just share some woes of the inconvenience my family and I will be facing as it will be several weeks till we can be considered as fully vaxxed. Side note that I'm appreciative to hear from someone who doesn't choose to immediately be prejudiced towards someone who says they don't prefer mRNA because the hate is very real now.,The purpose of my original comment was to just share some woes of the inconvenience my family and I will be facing as it will be several weeks till we can be considered as fully vaxxed.,inconvenience,my family and I will be facing,SADNESS,opinion_too_long

They attract enterprising and adventurous people from all over the world to go there, to live and work.“And the steady infusion of new arrivals sharpens them, sparks cross-fertilisation of ideas and cultures, and creates an environment of constant innovation and enterprise,” he said.Recalling his visit to Google’s headquarters in Silicon Valley two years ago, Mr Lee noted that most of the presenters he met had grandparents who hailed from all around the world.“That is America’s enormous advantage – it draws top talent from every continent, and therefore it can innovate and stay ahead,” he said, adding that Singapore must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world.“This is how we became a shining red dot. Because our ancestors came here from many lands, made this their home, and built up this country. And is what we must continue to do, to shine even brighter in future – not just for our own sakes, but for our children and grandchildren too.”MEASURED AND BALANCEDThe Singapore government is “keenly aware” of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, especially as the inflows are not small either, said Mr Lee.Every year, there are about 30,000 citizen babies born and Singapore takes in about 22,000 new citizens.“Even dragon year − last year − still not quite 30,000 citizen babies born. So we do need to bring in more people, more talent, more contributions,” he said.It is therefore crucial for Singapore to manage its immigration inflows carefully by keeping it measured and balanced, said Mr Lee. It is also important to pay close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups and people who are here, and take in people who can fit in and add to society.He highlighted various ways Singapore integrates its new residents.All of them undergo the Singapore Citizenship Journey prior to obtaining their citizenship. The Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the People’s Association also run programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities.“I hope now that you have become citizens, you will participate wholeheartedly in society, and make the effort to integrate,” he told the audience.“Learn our values and cultural norms, get involved and contribute actively to your communities.”""OUR SINGAPORE TEAM""Mr Lee said other Singaporeans must play their part too, such as by making friends with the new arrivals who may be neighbours, colleagues or schoolmates.He also encouraged Singaporeans to be “big-hearted” and welcome new citizens as valuable members of “our Singapore team”.“To help new citizens to fit in − to feel at home here, to pick up how our society works, and how we can live harmoniously together.

People's  stereotypes and beliefs don't change overnight, but they do change as each generation grows up.Our parents' generation grew up without having a common language with other races. They grew up in a period where communities look inwards for help and where that was the only concept of community. Singapore as a nation was in its infancy and even today, we are still trying to figure out what Singaporean really mean. What this probably mean was that anyone outside their familiar concept of community was alien and thus, there was little need to understand them and thus results in racism. Racism stemming from ignorance and not malicious intent, but still racism. But one thing I am sure, is that majority of the younger generations do not believe in all those ridiculous racial stereotypes once they reach an age where they can reason. I used to hear stereotypes about the minority races too, from relatives etc. But I don't think any of them are right. What is more important is that I won't pass them on to my kids, and I will educate my kids that these stereotypes are wrong. I hope to believe that there is a silent majority like me out there who will effect this inter generational change.I hope you can find hope in that things will change for the better. A decade or two ago, it would have been quite impossible for such casual racism or overt racism to be called out. I think it was largely because back then, there was an even lower degree of understanding of what racism really is. We are now aware that what was previously accepted (perhaps due to circumstances of the times when there were other more pressing concerns or simply greater ignorance in society) should not be accepted anymore now that we have grown as a society. The natural next step will be change for the better. I can't see our society ignoring these issues forever when we are already demonising racist individuals online. I can't say the same for everyone, but if my kid ever do anything racist, I can assure you that I will be the first to call it out, make sure that my kid learns what is wrong about it and make sure it does not happen again.","People's stereotypes and beliefs don't change overnight, but they do change as each generation grows up.",stereotypes and beliefs,do change as each generation grows up,JOY,opinion_too_long

3) in 2014, official result shown that 97 percent of crimea wished to join with russia. however, un (which consists of majorly members from nato and eu too) did not approved it from voting.

4) everyone know ukraine do not like russia. if ukraine join eurasian economic union (eaeu), there may not be a needs for war in 2014 and now to draw line for crimea, donetsk and luhans borders.

5) it is stupid for ukraine for failing to join nato and eu as member fast enough and still remain odd with russia.

6) if ukraine is nato and eu member now, ukraine will be canon fodder with benefits. nato and eu got obligation to attack russia immediately and assist ukraine to recover after postwar.

7) now ukraine is just a canon fodder without any benefits. nato and eu can wait unit ukraine lost the war and russia is weaker before attacking russia. after postwar, ukraine may no longer exist and a new master will take over that piece of land.

He convinces himself he's noble, because strange men leave happy, and he donates to charitable causes with that money. Just like how scammers convinced themselves that they create thousands of jobs, in the fight of trying to stop them.The wife feels abused, betrayed and used, while getting only a fraction of her earnings.

Say what you will about experts' comments and evidence about the safety of mrna vaccines, I'm no expert to challenge it, but I don't think it's unreasonable to choose a different vaccine that my family and I feel more comfortable with, as opposed to the mrna ones that the majority are taking. It's not even that I don't want to get vaxxed, I just want a different vax. Any take on such a view? We don't think that vaccines are ineffective, nor think that it's some chip that government tries to implant in us to track us or whatever. I have also taken other vaccines, such as the one against cervical cancer, so I don't doubt the effectiveness of vaccines in general. It is simply a matter of preference that we chose Sinopharm as opposed to the ones in the national programme, and I don't think it's a luxury to be able to have a choice. The problem is, people who follow the news might know that Sinopharm arrived in Singapore only in late Aug to early Sep, and the days following its arrival, you might also have seen news about the high demand and overwhelming response for it. My family members and I made appointments with multiple providers of it but to no avail because appointments were booked so quickly that I wasn't quick enough to be part of the first batch to receive it. My second dose is in slightly under a week, meaning that it would be about 3 weeks before I'm counted as fully vaxxed. I can accept the dine-in restrictions, and while it means some inconvenience or not having the occasional luxury of dining at certain establishments, it does not exactly affect my way of life. But to restrict entry into malls, means I cannot takeaway food from anywhere but hawker centres/coffee shops or standalone outlets - which are rather inconvenient from my school and home - nor go grocery shopping, many of which are in malls. Nevermind that I can't buy takeout from certain food outlets in malls, guess I'll cook more often, but wait, I can't go grocery shopping. You're gonna tell me that I can go to standalone outlets, but as aforementioned, there are none near my school or home. I would have to go out of my way to carry out these basic activities and increase travel time and exposure. I see comments like: ""I can't go grocery shopping! Well then get vaxxed you idiot"" Do we not remember that it takes over a month for the entire regime? And at this point in time where the government boasts about over 85% vaccination rate, and the measures never being this extreme in the past yet is such during a time when they say we are making progress, is it really necessary at this very moment?As Sinopharm was not part of the national programme, it was a lot more inconvenient to get it, but inconvenience aside, it was nearly impossible to during the initial stages because of the overwhelming demand. I am just a student that still has to go to school almost everyday, buy lunch or dinner back occasionally for my family, and go grocery shopping on my way home sometimes.

2) shiok meats with their invention of shrimp meat from cells potentially able to cut down seafood import

3) Creative Technology

4) Razor Gaming Tech

5) Mini DNA reading device from Illumina Singapore

3579,"Top tier arguments dude.>'Objectively wrong' is more of your own opinion, seeing that I made opinionated points on my own interactions with parents that seemed to only have the best interests of their own pride in having 'elite children' that appear to only be able to read from a book slightly better than others. To say that I am 'Objectively wrong' would mean that my 'Objective' of stating on the simple fact that there are talents that require no form of education is complete bullshit, because apparently everyone is a braindead retard until they realise their 'place in life'. Guess what? No you didn't. You made general statements that 1) it's not cool to brag about education because people can achieve it given enough time 2) people with good grades are muggers and had grades beaten into them And when you got called out you changed your stance to ""I can't be objectively wrong because I'm stating an opinion"" and why did parents come into the picture? Anyway let me address your arguments. 1) I agree that it's not nice to brag but usually it's the parents rather than the kids that are doing it. As for the latter part, this is objectively wrong as the other person has pointed out. Firstly, not anyone can achieve a given academic qualification given enough time. Secondly, even if they could, it also shows that they are less competitive/able than someone who could do it quicker. A company is not going to take a chance on Bob who took 20 years to finish his CS degree. His knowledge is probably obsolete. Either that or they pay him as much as a fresh grad at 50 years old. How's he going to retire? Now obviously there are people who due to circumstances beyond their control couldn't get good grades in school. But there are also people with inferior cognitive and analytical capabilities than others. That's why we have EM3 streams. Of course there will always be false positives but that's how life is For (2) it's easy just look at universities. Clearly some people are getting perfect CAP and their parents clearly aren't beating them at that age. 3) talent is irrelevant to getting good grades I attended the GEP in secondary school. Many of my batchmates got 7-9 A1s without tuition, beatings or working particularly hard (playing starcraft/MMOs through exam period). Similar observations in JC although coursework is more challenging. Many people mug like hell and perform worse than other people who don't study much.Yeah there are talents in every sector not just academic.

The difference between massively reducing going out and being straight-up banned might not seem like a big one to you, but I can guarantee it is a huge difference to someone like me. Before this, my family and I were making grocery runs at 24 hour supermarkets at 11pm. We were already avoiding crowds and limiting our social interaction. Those last shreds of mobility were what prevented full-blown cabin fever. Consider this: people like me are not at risk just from COVID, but even common cold.

4841,"Hey! Thanks for the insightful comment. I too feel confused from recent events when it comes to drawing lines.I'll speak candidly about a recent incident. A parody of the gong lady incident was made by an ""influencer"" which was deemed offensive and then taken down. I am one of those who did not watch it, so it leaves me speculating as to what was actually in the video.In an ideal world, probably no one would have made such a video that would be construed as offensive. As a majority who wants to learn more about sensitivity and empathy, would it be more prudent to leave the video up as an example of what not to do? Of course when it is in the domain of inciting hate and violence it should be taken down, but in instances where it might not be the case, where do we draw the lines to determine if we were to let an offensive material be available?A main talking point is how we should not shy away from the reality that there is racism, and that we should acknowledge the existence of it and not sweep it under the rug anymore. But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.So my honest question to a minority would be whether ""cancelling"" an offensive piece of work end up actually causing more harm than intended? Would it be tantamount to not acknowledging the scourge of racism? I'm a majority who sincerely wants to learn more, and because that video has been removed, all I know is that it was racist and not why it was racist. It leaves me to feel that I should not engage a minority for the fear of unintentionally being offensive.I'm not sure if that is how I want it to be. Should Hanlon's razor be used to never attribute to malice which is adequately explained by stupidity?","But because I found out about a parody that was taken down and that I do not have a chance to see it, there is a lot of speculation on my end as to what was construed as racist or offensive.",speculation,as to what was construed as racist,SADNESS,opinion_too_long

4971,Hmm I personally agree that leaving such offensive works up for other people to learn what not to do would be a good idea. But if they are left up someone who might not know about the situation might come across it first and garner racist ideas from it (I’ve not watched this video too but I remember the video made by an Indian youtuber after the brown face controversy) Perhaps we should allow news channels like CNA and Straits times to include such videos in their articles. That way the viewer will have to read through the whole story and know that this is bad before they see it (and get warned of the potentially explicit content if any is included) censorship of extreme vulgarities and middle finger can also be done if needed to protect the children) That way we can still learn from it while the government can also making a public statement condemning these actions by taking down the videos. One might argue that even on news channels these videos could instigate feelings of resentment but I still feel that the risk is worth it if more people can learn from the incidents.,That way the viewer will have to read through the whole story and know that this is bad before they see it.,this,is bad,SADNESS,vague_entity

PAP officially comes up with a stance. It comes from LHL and the stance is very clear. They present reasons and arguments on why holding such stance. Whether you agree or disagree with it, you know what the party thinks and you can make a judgement. Party members who do not follow the line shall either be punished by the party, or be questioned by voters.

What WP doing now is to dodge the question. It shows no responsibility,
no courage, and no unity in defending what WP thinks as the leading opposition party.

Imagine that it was not about 377A, but say GST hike or quota on work visa for example. Can you accept a political party that its voting members are taking different sides? Then why do I bother to vote and support a party as a foxy in the parliament of its members can take its own decision at its convenience? How is it representing my interest as a voter?

Instead of staying where they are and making their own country better, they took the easy route and are just joining the winning team.

In this instance if you're not in the loop, it appears that the content creator is apologetic while some minorities are very angry.

I'm not sure that's helpful.While true that material may be digested in a harmful manner, another problem presents itself. I personally would feel that outright hateful and incendiary material should not be allowed, but past that where do we draw the line? Would it be somewhat similar as not talking about racial issues?Interpretation is a tricky thing too, a recent example would be [this comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nxfb7z/celebrity_wedding_in_singapore_circa_2021/) I shared yesterday. I found it funny but others didn't. As much as the artist tried to explain his intentions, it was not necessarily accepted. I'm not too keen to stifle any artistic or creative freedom, maybe we can try not to attribute to malice what could adequately be explained by stupidity (Hanlon's Razor). Not literally stupidity but perhaps unintentional.I guess it's really too complex a problem and ideally everyone truly has no malice in terms of content creation or art, thus no work would be construed as offensive, and this wouldn't be a problem.Anyway, /u/Great_Environment381 did explain [the context of the anger](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ny12v4/im_so_sick_of_it/h1i9wr3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), which really helps as within my circle of friends I'd be able to provide context as to why minorities are outraged and not just minorities are outraged.

Even in a professional setting, some people tend to get astounded when they meet me for the first time. I've ran through the whole range of comments, from 'wow you're pretty hard working for a Malay' to 'wah first time I see Malay so highly educated'. And I'm not even most educated amongst my siblings, only holding a Masters whilst my brother has a PhD.At the end of the day, whilst I wish that people in general will be kinder to each other, there is nothing much I can do but to control my own reactions to the situation.

7691,"I said it once and I'll say it again as a PoV from a 14 year old, I'm now in secondary school(obviously) and recently did a Geographical Investigation project, basically we we're supposed to do a survey. Idk why but previously I had a very good impression of Singapore and Singaporeans, but afterwards, I thought the opposite. Just because I needed their help for a survey, some of them were quite rude when they declined to do when asked. It's not that hard to say sorry, but I don't wish to do it. I understand how annoying it is for a person to be pestered to take flyers and asked about surveys or even sign up for insurance or credit cards by sales people, but everyone have to earn a living, it's not that hard to decline POLITELY.

8379,"ukraine was the country with the third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons when the soviet union collapsed

ukraine committed to full disarmament in exchange for economic compensation and security assurances.

the country had accepted economic assistance from the u.s. to dismantle missiles, bombers, and nuclear infrastructure,

uranium.

ukraine transferred its last nuclear warhead to russia in 1996 and dismantled its last strategic nuclear delivery vehicle in 2001.

russia, the u.s., and the u.k. agreed to respect the “independence and sovereignty and existing borders of ukraine” after the country agreed to give up its nuclear stockpile. ukraine was also promised that its territorial integrity and political independence will be maintained and that the signatories will not use economic coercion against ukraine to their own advantage.

If it is, everyone you speak with will not be a racist , but yet minorities are on the receiving end of microaggressions and overt racism so often. I think it's more important to question our prejudices and stereotypes that lead to certain behavior.3. When kids behave like shit, it's largely due to their parents. My parents said some pretty racist things behind closed doors back when I was a kid... Agree with other posters that bullying affect all kids but that's conflating different issues together.4.

Offer these salaries to student part timers, provide work flexibility to accomodate their class schedules, and you'll see you don't have a lack of applicants, you won't have to drastically increase your prices and hence lose your customers, and you can do the right thing by supporting our local economy and our locals.

The 10% service charge is suppose to be given back and divided amongst the staff.
In fact all F&B doesn’t do that and it goes into their coffers. Depending on actual tips from customers is miserable.
